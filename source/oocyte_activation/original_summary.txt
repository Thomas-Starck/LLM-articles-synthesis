We are uncertain about the effect of AOA on the live birth and miscarriage rates in women undergoing ART ICSI. In the subpopulation of those who have had a previous history of low or no fertilization, AOA may result in an increase in the live birth rate when compared to conventional ICSI without AOA, while making little or no difference to the miscarriage rate. There was considerable variation in the protocols used for chemical AOA, which affects the generalizability of the findings. Due to the very low to low certainty of evidence, the results should be interpreted with caution.
