We aim to evaluate the benefits and harms of artificial oocyte activation in women affected by infertility undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment.

We want to find out the benefits and risks of performing the additional step of artificial oocyte activation in women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment, compared to routine ICSI.

We also want to find out whether one method of artificial oocyte activation is better than another method.

We plan to pool the results from high‚Äêquality studies and evaluate our level of certainty about the evidence.
