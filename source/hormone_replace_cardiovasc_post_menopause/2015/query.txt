We aim to assess the effects of hormone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in post‐menopausal women, and whether there are differential effects between use in primary or secondary prevention.

Secondary aims were to undertake exploratory analyses to (i) assess the impact of time since menopause that treatment was commenced (≥ 10 years versus < 10 years), and where these data were not available, use age of trial participants at baseline as a proxy (≥ 60 years of age versus < 60 years of age); and (ii) assess the effects of length of time on treatment.
