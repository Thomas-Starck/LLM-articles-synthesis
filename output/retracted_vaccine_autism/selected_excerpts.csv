The “opioid excess” theory of autism, put forward first
by Panksepp and colleagues7 and later by Reichelt and
colleagues8 and Shattock and colleagues9 proposes that
autistic disorders result from the incomplete breakdown
and excessive absorption of gut-derived peptides from
foods, including barley, rye, oats, and caesin from milk
and dairy produce."

measles encephalitis, although in most cases no cause is
ever identified.14 Viral encephalitis can give rise to autistic
disorders, particularly when it occurs early in life.15
Rubella virus is associated with autism and the combined
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than
monovalent measles vaccine) has also been implicated.
Fudenberg16 noted that for 15 of 20 autistic children, the
first symptoms developed within a week of vaccination.
Gupta17 commented on the striking association between
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and the onset of
behavioural symptoms in all the children that he had
investigated for regressive autism. Measles virus18,19 and
measles vaccination20 have both been implicated as risk

EARLY REPORT
factors for Crohn’s disease and persistent measles
vaccine-strain virus infection has been found in children
with autoimmune hepatitis.21
We did not prove an association between measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described.
Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve
this issue.
If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and
rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence
might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine
in the UK in 1988. Published evidence is inadequate to
show whether there is a change in incidence22 or a link
with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.23 A genetic
predisposition to autistic-spectrum disorders is suggested
by over-representation in boys and a greater concordance
rate in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins.15 In the
context of susceptibility to infection, a genetic association
with autism, linked to a null allele of the complement (C)
4B gene located in the class III region of the major-
histocompatibility complex, has been recorded by Warren
and colleagues.24 C4B-gene products are crucial for the
activation of the complement pathway and protection
against infection: individuals inheriting one or two C4B
null alleles may not handle certain viruses appropriately,
possibly including attenuated strains."

These studies, together with our own, including evidence

support the hypothesis that the consequences of an
inflamed or dysfunctional intestine may play a part in
behavioural changes in some children.
