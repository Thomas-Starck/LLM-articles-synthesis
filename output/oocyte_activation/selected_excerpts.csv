Introduction
Since the introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injec-
tion
(ICSI)
into
assisted
reproductive
technologies
(ARTs), there have been numerous studies on the
effects of the male gamete regarding its morphology,
quality and capacity to activate the oocyte for success-
ful fertilization (Berkovitz et al., 2006; Moaz, Khattab,
Foutouh,
&
Mohsen,
2006;
Nasr-Esfahani,
Razavi,
Mardani, Shirazi, & Javanmardi, 2007). Since complete
fertilization failures and low or moderate fertilization
rates are still common in ART practice, sperm selection
and oocyte activation are points of interest for improv-
ing clinical outcomes in male factor infertility (De Vos
et al., 2003; Dozortsev & Nasr-Esfahani, 2012; Ebner
et al., 2012).
Intracytoplasmic injection of spermatozoa selected
according to fine morphology under high magnifica-
tion (intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm
injection, IMSI) is used to identify a morphologically
normal spermatozoon by precise measurement of
length and width of the sperm head and vacuoles.
This technique has been used to improve assisted
reproduction outcomes in cases of male factor infertil-
ity, in terms of improved fertilization rates and ART
outcome (Antinori et al., 2008; Balaban et al., 2011;
Berkovitz et al., 2006; De Vos et al., 2013).
The oocyte activating ability of the spermatozoon is
a critical factor for fertilization."

ABSTRACT
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of artificial oocyte activation (AOA) by calcium ionophore
after intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI) on fertilization, cleavage
rate and embryo quality. A total of 194 oocytes from 21 cycles from women with a history of
low fertilization rate accompanying teratozoospermia were enrolled over a 3-month period.
Mature oocytes from each patient were randomly allocated into two groups after IMSI. In the
study group, half of the patients’ oocytes (n ¼ 97) were exposed to AOA, and in the control
group (n ¼ 97), AOA was not applied. The mean number of mature oocytes, fertilization and
cleavage rates were similar between the study and control groups (p > 0.05 for each). However,
fertilized oocytes of the AOA group were less likely to produce top quality embryos when calcu-
lated per fertilized oocyte (28/80; 35.0% versus 38/71; 53.5%, respectively; p ¼ 0.024) and also
per cycle (13/21; 61.9% versus 20/21; 95.24%, respectively; p ¼ 0.006). Our study indicates that
AOA may not improve fertilization rates after IMSI and may even reduce the ability of a success-
fully fertilized oocyte to develop into a top quality embryo."

appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Furthermore, it
was shown that ICSI-AOA is not beneﬁcial for all patients with a sus-

elaborate and experimental technique, it should only be considered
in case of a well-diagnosed indication.

Objective: To evaluate the electrical activation of oocytes in patients with previously failed or limited fertilization
after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and in patients with possible failure of fertilization.
Design: Prospective randomized study.
Setting: A private IVF center in Egypt.
Patient(s): Two hundred forty-six patients with severe oligoasthenospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia with
total teratospermia or totally immotile spermatozoa were selected for the study. Patients who previously had total
failure or limited fertilization after ICSI also were included.
Intervention(s): Sibling oocytes were randomly divided after ICSI into two groups: the study group (n ¼ 1,640)
was subjected to electroactivation, and the control group (n ¼ 1,435), to no electroactivation. Electroactivation was
performed by using a double-square direct-current pulse. Embryo transfer was performed with the best available
embryos.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Fertilization rate, degeneration rate, and pregnancy outcome.
Result(s): Two hundred forty-one ICSI cycles were included in the study. The fertilization rate was statistically
signiﬁcantly higher in the electroactivated group as compared with in the control group (68% vs 60%, odds ratio
¼ 1.397, 95% conﬁdence interval ¼ 1.197 to 1.629). The oocyte degeneration rate was not statistically signiﬁcantly
different between the two groups (5.9% vs 4.9%, odds ratio ¼ 0.96, 95% conﬁdence interval ¼ 0.73 to 1.26). In
total, 112 clinical pregnancies resulted (pregnancy rate ¼ 46.5%)."
8,Nasr‐Esfahani (2008).pdf,0.9079509447076552,"The results of Table 2 reveal that not only the fertilization
rate has been improved by artiﬁcial oocyte activation, but in
addition, cleavage rate 72 hours post-ICSI. Therefore, it can
be concluded that in cases with severe teratozoospermia ar-
tiﬁcial oocyte activation may improve fertilization and cleav-
age rate 72 hours after ICSI. These results are consistent with
the results obtained using different artiﬁcial activation proto-
col for bovine oocytes, which suggests that different activa-
tion protocols affect the developmental competence or
blastocyst rate (45). Furthermore, addition of protein kinase
inhibitor, like 6-DAMP, to activation protocol in bovine
oocytes, signiﬁcantly improves the blastocyst rate (45, 46).
Thus, proper activation of oocytes may help the developmen-
tal competence of the oocytes and explain the increased
cleavage and embryo quality rate observed in the AOA
group.
The results of this study also reveal that in the control
group, as expected, the fertilization rate is slightly, but insig-
niﬁcantly (P¼.088) higher in the semen sample when motile
sperm are available for ICSI, compared with cases where mo-
tile sperm are not available for ICSI. However, in the artiﬁ-
cially activated oocyte subgroup with immotile sperm the
fertilization rate improves and is not signiﬁcantly different
from the artiﬁcial oocyte activated subgroup with motile
sperm, thus concluding that artiﬁcial activation has a greater
effect on fertilization rate in the semen samples with immo-
tile sperm compared with those with the motile sperm. Naka-
gawa et al. (25) found that 84.9% of failed fertilized oocytes
after ICSI-exposed calcium ionophore A23187 and puromy-
cin were activated, and about 64% were cleaved. They further
reported that oocyte activation improves fertilization rate of
semen samples with the immotile sperm, which is inconsis-
tent with our results.
In the present study, sperm abnormality was not catego-
rized; however, a recent study by Moaz et al."

Design: Laboratory study.
Setting: Isfahan fertility and infertility Center, and Royan institute, Tehran, Iran.
Patient(s): Eighty-seven couples with male factor etiology (severe teratozoospermia) undergoing ICSI.
Intervention(s): Ionomycin for artiﬁcial oocyte activation.
Main Outcome Measure(s): After oocyte collection, the oocytes were randomly divided into two groups: control
and artiﬁcial oocyte activation (AOA). The injected oocytes in the control group were cultured in G1. The remain-
ing oocytes were chemically activated by exposure to 10 mM Ionomycin for 10 minutes. Around 16 to 18 hours
after ICSI, fertilization was assessed by the presence of pronuclei. The percentage of cleavage and high-quality
embryos were calculated 48 and 72 hours after ICSI. Clinical pregnancy also was determined based on ultrasound
observation of a fetal heart beat.
Result(S): There are signiﬁcant differences in the mean of fertilization and cleavage rates 72 hours after ICSI be-
tween AOA and control groups. In patients who had no fertilization in the control group and all the embryos for
transfer derived from the AOA group, two pregnancies were recorded."

On the basis of the experience of other researchers (8, 9), we
decided to test electroactivation in a pilot study ﬁrst. Electro-
activation of oocytes after ICSI was performed for 10 patients
in our center who had had previous total failure of fertiliza-
tion in 11 ICSI cycles. After the encouraging results of these
10 cases, approval was obtained from the institutional review
board of the Egyptian IVF-ET Center to perform oocyte elec-
troactivation in cases with expected poor fertilization in a ran-
domized controlled study. The study included 241 ICSI
cycles for infertile couples with severe oligoasthenoterato-
spermia (OAT) or azoospermia. Poor fertilization or failure
of fertilization was expected because of 100% abnormal
sperm morphology or totally immotile sperms. The patients
were counseled and signed consent forms. The female part-
ners were <40 years of age and had normal hormonal proﬁles

randomly divided after ICSI into two groups: the study group
(electroactivation) and the control group (without electroac-
tivation). The embryologists who allocated the oocytes and
those who followed them afterward were blinded to the ran-
domization.

STUDY QUESTION: Are pregnancy and birth rates affected by artiﬁcial oocyte activation (AOA) with SrCl2 or calcimycin after ICSI for
couples with male-factor infertility linked to abnormal sperm morphology or for couples with previous ICSI cycles of unexplained low fertiliza-
tion or inadequate fertilization associated with impaired oocyte morphology?
SUMMARY ANSWER: AOA with either SrCl2 or calcimycin can improve the rates of clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy and live birth
compared with ICSI alone, and the two agents have diverse effects for different subgroups of patients.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: ICSI is a successful treatment for infertility, but not in all individuals."

total, 112 clinical pregnancies resulted (pregnancy rate ¼ 46.5%). Total fertilization failure occurred in 5 cycles in
the control group, and none failed in the study group.
Conclusion(s): Oocyte electroactivation after ICSI signiﬁcantly improved the fertilization rate in severe oligoas-
thenoteratospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia. (Fertil Steril 2009;91:133–9. 2009 by American Society

Key Words: ICSI, fertilization, electrical activation, total fertilization failure
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has become the most
effective therapeutic treatment for male-factor infertility (1).
However, total failure of fertilization still occurs in some
cases, such as globozoospermia (2), teratozoospermia (3),
immotile spermatozoa (4), and even unexplained cases (5).
Total fertilization failure is a rare event in cases with normal
oocytes and spermatozoa, but it can even occur repeatedly
(6). It is estimated that failed fertilization occurs in 2%–3%
of ICSI cycles (7, 8).
In ICSI, because the spermatozoa is injected inside the
ooplasm, failure of pronuclear formation and division most
probably is the result of the failure of oocyte activation.
Many investigators have tried different techniques for oocyte
activation after ICSI to overcome this problem. Ionophore
treatment for oocyte activation after ICSI resulted in the birth
of a healthy baby in a case of previously failed fertilization
due to globozoospermia (2). Intracytoplasmic sperm injec-
tion followed by electrical oocyte activation resulted in the
delivery of healthy twins for a couple with previously failed
fertilization after ICSI (9). Recently, it was demonstrated that
oocyte activation enabled normal fertilization and pregnancy
in sperm and oocyte–related fertilization failure (8). The aim
of this study was to estimate the value of the electrical activa-
tion of oocytes in patients with previously failed or limited
fertilization after ICSI, as well as in patients with the possi-
bility of failed fertilization as a result of teratozoospermia."
