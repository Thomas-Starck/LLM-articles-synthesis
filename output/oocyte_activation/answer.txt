Embedded summary of the selected excerpts:


Artificial oocyte activation (AOA) after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can improve clinical and embryological outcomes compared to ICSI alone. The use of AOA with SrCl2 or calcimycin has shown to increase rates of clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and live birth. Different methods of AOA have diverse effects for different subgroups of patients.



LLM-Generated Answer based on selected excerpts and context:

Based on the excerpts provided, here is an evaluation of the benefits and harms of artificial oocyte activation (AOA) in women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment:

1. **Benefits of Artificial Oocyte Activation**:
   - AOA may improve fertilization rates in specific cases, particularly in patients with severe teratozoospermia or other male factor infertility issues. For instance, one study indicated that AOA with calcium ionophore improved fertilization and cleavage rates in such patients (Excerpt 8).
   - Another study found that electrical activation of oocytes after ICSI significantly improved fertilization rates in patients with severe oligoasthenoteratospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia (Excerpt 19).

2. **Harms and Risks of Artificial Oocyte Activation**:
   - Some studies suggest that AOA may not improve fertilization rates and could potentially reduce the quality of embryos. For example, one study reported that AOA did not enhance fertilization rates after IMSI and may decrease the likelihood of producing top-quality embryos (Excerpt 2, Excerpt 3).
   - Additionally, AOA is not beneficial for all patients, particularly those without a diagnosed oocyte activation deficiency. It should be considered an experimental technique and applied only in well-defined cases (Excerpt 5).

3. **Comparison of AOA Methods**:
   - Different methods of AOA, such as using calcium ionophore or electrical activation, have shown varying results. For instance, one study indicated that AOA with either SrCl2 or calcimycin improved clinical and embryological outcomes compared to ICSI alone, suggesting that the choice of method may influence outcomes (Excerpt 18).

In summary, while AOA can provide benefits in specific cases of male factor infertility, it may also carry risks of reduced embryo quality and is not universally beneficial. The choice of activation method may also affect the outcomes.
