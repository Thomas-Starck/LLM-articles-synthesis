Embedded summary of the selected excerpts:


The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and short- and long-term adverse effects of the trivalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, and mumps strains (MMR), the concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), and the tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV) in children up to 15 years old.



LLM-Generated Answer based on selected excerpts and context:

The effectiveness, safety, and adverse effects of the MMR, MMR+V, and MMRV vaccines in preventing measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox in children up to 15 years old can be summarized as follows:

1. **Effectiveness**:
   - The two-dose MMRV vaccine demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 95.0% against all varicella cases and 99.0% against moderate to severe varicella (Excerpt 84). In comparison, the one-dose MMR+V vaccine had an efficacy of 67.0% against all varicella and 90.3% against moderate to severe varicella (Excerpt 84).
   - Over a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the efficacy of two doses of MMRV against all varicella cases was 95.4%, while the efficacy of one dose of varicella vaccine (MMR+V) was 67.2% (Excerpt 12). This indicates that MMRV provides superior long-term protection compared to MMR+V.

2. **Safety**:
   - Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in similar proportions across the vaccine groups, with none deemed vaccine-related by investigators (Excerpt 61). The overall safety profile of MMRV and MMR+V was consistent with established profiles of these vaccines (Excerpt 26).
   - Common adverse reactions included fever and injection-site redness, with a higher incidence of fever reported in the MMRV group compared to the MMR+V and MMR groups (Excerpt 11, 12). Specifically, 57% of participants in the MMRV group reported fever of 38Â°C or more within 15 days of the first dose (Excerpt 11).

3. **Adverse Effects**:
   - The most frequently reported adverse effects were mild and included injection-site redness and fever (Excerpt 11, 12). Serious adverse events were rare and not considered related to vaccination (Excerpt 61).
   - There were reports of febrile convulsions and herpes zoster, but these were not confirmed as directly related to the vaccines (Excerpt 4, 11).

In conclusion, the MMRV vaccine is highly effective in preventing varicella and offers better long-term protection compared to the MMR+V vaccine. Both vaccines have acceptable safety profiles, with mild adverse effects being more common than serious ones.
