GSK has developed a combined tetravalent measles-mumps-
rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV; Priorix-Tetra) that offers conve-
nience for parents and medical practitioners by combining the
beneﬁts of measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccination in a
single injection, and would therefore improve the vaccine coverage
both against chickenpox and against measles, mumps and rubella.
Moreover, meningococcal vaccines could be co-administered with
MMRV at the same clinical visit [10]. The immunogenicity and
safety of the combined MMRV have been demonstrated in clinical
trials; MMRV was licensed based on comparative immunogenicity
trials versus monovalent varicella vaccines [11–13].
Phase A of this phase III, observer-blinded, randomized, con-
trolled, multicenter study (NCT00226499) assessed protection
against varicella in naive children who received two doses of
MMRV or one dose of monovalent varicella vaccine at 12–22
months of age. After a mean follow-up of approximately three
years, efﬁcacy of two doses of MMRV against all varicella was
94.9% (97.5% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 92.4–96.6), and against mod-
erate to severe varicella was 99.5% (97.5% CI: 97.5–99.9). Efﬁcacy of
one-dose varicella vaccine was 65.4% (97.5% CI: 57.2–72.1) against
all varicella and 90.7% (97.5% CI: 85.9–93.9) against moderate to
severe varicella [14].
We report the efﬁcacy, antibody persistence and safety data up
to six years after the second vaccine dose. Long term follow-up is
ongoing and will extend up to ten years post-vaccination.

Summary
Background The duration of protection provided by varicella vaccines is unclear. We assessed the 10-year vaccine 
efficacy of two doses of a combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV), one live attenuated varicella 
vaccine (V) dose given after one measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) dose (MMR + V), versus two MMR doses 
(control vaccine) for the prevention of confirmed varicella.
Methods This was a phase 3b follow-up of an observer-blinded, randomised, controlled trial. In phase a, children aged 
12–22 months (at first vaccination) from Czech Republic (Czechia), Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, 
Russia, Slovakia, and Sweden were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation list (3:3:1) to receive 
two doses of MMRV, one dose of MMR and one dose of varicella vaccine, or two doses of MMR, 42 days apart. 
Varicella cases were confirmed by detection of viral DNA, or epidemiological link and clinical assessment, by an 
independent data monitoring committee; disease severity was based on a modified Vázquez scale. Hazard ratios for 
MMRV and MMR + V versus MMR estimated in the per-protocol cohort using a Cox proportional hazards regression 
model were used to calculate vaccine efficacy and 95% CI. Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the study 
in all vaccinated children. Study objectives were secondary and descriptive."

Background: This phase III B follow-up of an initial multicenter study (NCT00226499) will evaluate the
ten-year efﬁcacy of two doses of the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) and
one dose of the live attenuated varicella vaccine (V) versus a measles-mumps-rubella control group
(MMR) for the prevention of clinical varicella disease. Here we present efﬁcacy results for six years
post-vaccination.
Methods: In phase A of the study, healthy children aged 12–22 months from ten European countries were
randomized (3:3:1) and received either two doses of MMRV, or one dose of combined MMR and one dose
of monovalent varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or two doses of the MMR vaccine (control), 42 days apart.
Vaccine efﬁcacy against all and against moderate or severe varicella (conﬁrmed by detection of viral
DNA or epidemiological link) was assessed from six weeks up to six years post-dose 2 for the MMRV
and MMR+V groups, and was calculated with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI)."

MMRV, MMR + V, and MMR control groups reported 
losing time from work as a result of their child’s illness. 
The median time lost from work was 27 h in the MMRV 
group, 40 h in the MMR + V group, and 48 h in the MMR 
control group (appendix). The median time lost from 
planned activities, such as nursery, school, or day care 
reported by parents of children with confirmed varicella 
infection was 36 h in the MMRV group, 42 h in the 
MMR + V group, and 50 h in the MMR control group. 
The proportion of parents who stated that they would

Summary
Background Rates of varicella have decreased substantially in countries implementing routine varicella vaccination. 
Immunisation is possible with monovalent varicella vaccine or a combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine 
(MMRV). We assessed protection against varicella in naive children administered one dose of varicella vaccine or two 
doses of MMRV.
Methods This study was done in ten European countries with endemic varicella. Healthy children aged 12–22 months 
were randomised (3:3:1 ratio, by computer-generated randomisation list, with block size seven) to receive 42 days apart 
(1) two doses of MMRV (MMRV group), or (2) MMR at dose one and monovalent varicella vaccine at dose two (MMR+V 
group), or (3) two doses of MMR (MMR group; control). Participants and their parents or guardians, individuals 
involved in assessment of any outcome, and sponsor staff involved in review or analysis of data were masked to 
treatment assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was occurrence of confirmed varicella (by detection of varicella 
zoster virus DNA or epidemiological link) from 42 days after the second vaccine dose to the end of the first phase of the 
trial. Cases were graded for severity. Efficacy analyses were per protocol. Safety analyses included all participants who 
received at least one vaccine dose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00226499."
7,bb‐Ahlgren (2009).pdf,0.9108011345309435,"Child health and school health records
Information about infections with measles, mumps, rubella
and varicella and vaccinations against these diseases was
collected from child health and school health records.
Vaccination categories
Vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella were
administered as vaccinations containing monovalent vac-
cine strains or as vaccinations with the trivalent MMR
vaccine, i.e. the combination of measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine strains. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations
were either ‘‘early’’, i.e. before or at 10 years, or ‘‘late’’, i.e.
after 10 years. The rationale for this division was that the
majority of the vaccinations were given around age
12 years (90%), or at ages 1–8 years (54%). Less than 3%
of the vaccinations were given at other ages (Table 3). The
ﬁrst analysis was performed on the entire study material of
vaccinations with monovalent or combined measles, mumps
and rubella vaccines. We deﬁned three disjointed catego-
ries of vaccinations: ‘No vaccination’, ‘Early vaccination
only’, and ‘Late vaccination’. The group of individuals who
received ‘‘late’’ vaccination ([10 years of age) also inclu-
ded those who had received both a late and a prior early
vaccination. The group of individuals vaccinated ‘‘early
only’’ was restricted to those vaccinated below or at
10 years of age. The major part of the entire material was
MMR vaccinations. The second analysis was therefore
restricted to the subgroup of the MMR vaccinations. Four
disjointed vaccination categories: ‘No MMR vaccination’,
‘Early MMR vaccination only’, ‘Late MMR vaccination
only’, and ‘Both an early and a late MMR vaccination’ were
deﬁned. Comparisons were made within the group of MMR
vaccinations.
Validation
The proportion of MS patients for whom information about
their history of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella
infections was available from both the questionnaire and
from the child health and school health record was 35.2%
of the total number of questionnaire responders."

1. Introduction
Varicella (chickenpox), caused by the varicella-zoster virus
(VZV), is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease, respon-
sible for 4.2 million hospitalizations and 4200 deaths annually,
worldwide [1]. In countries where universal vaccination was intro-
duced, the incidence of varicella cases, including hospitalizations
and deaths, has substantially declined [2–5].
An important aspect in the design of universal immunization
programs against varicella is the number of doses. While one-
dose schedules were shown to be effective against the disease,
breakthrough cases were still reported [2–6]. Out of the 33 coun-
tries that recommended varicella containing vaccines, 14 recom-
mended a two-dose schedule. Another important aspect is the
choice of vaccine, i.e. monovalent or combined varicella vaccine.
Improved
uptake
rates
might
be
achieved
by
the
co-
administration of varicella-containing vaccines with routine child-
hood vaccines or with the use of combined varicella-containing
vaccines [7].
GSK’s trivalent measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR; Priorix)
and the monovalent live attenuated varicella vaccine (V; Varilrix)
are licensed in many countries worldwide. Both vaccines are indi-
cated for active immunization of children at least 9 months of age,
and can be given concomitantly, but at separate injection sites
[8,9]."

from the reactogenicity subset; one from a participant 
9 days after the first dose of MMRV (and related to 
vaccination), and another from a par­ticipant 20 days after 
monovalent varicella vaccine (at dose two and not related 
to vaccination).
Discussion
In this study of more than 5000 children, efficacy of two-
dose MMRV against all varicella was almost 95%, and 
against moderate to severe varicella was more than 99%. 
This protection was greater than for one-dose varicella 
vaccine, which had efficacy against all varicella of about 
65%, and against moderate to severe varicella of roughly 
91%. Redness was the most frequently reported solicited 
injection-site symptom in each group and after each dose 
(up to 25% of participants). More participants in the 
MMRV group (about 57%) reported fever of 38°C or more 
within 15 days of dose one than in the other groups 
(40–45%). Occurrence of serious adverse events deemed 
related to vaccination was three in the MMRV group, four 
in the MMR+V group, and one in the MMR group.
As far as we are aware, this is the first study to assess 
vaccine efficacy of one and two doses of live varicella 
vaccines in comparison with a control vaccine, and in a 
uniform age cohort living in a setting of endemic VZV 
transmission (panel).7 We used a randomised, observer-
blind, parallel group design with active case ascertainment 
that deemed even mild rash to be illnesses. These results 
describe the first 3 years of follow-up, but more data for 
longer term protection are anticipated with the analysis of 
10 years of follow-up in the same study cohort."
12,aa-Povey (2019).pdf,0.9070796035579669,"Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the study 
in all vaccinated children. Study objectives were secondary and descriptive. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT00226499.
Findings Between Sept 1, 2005, and May 10, 2006, 5803 children (mean age 14·2 months, SD 2·5) were vaccinated. 
The per-protocol cohort included 2279 children from the MMRV group, 2266 from the MMR + V group, and 744 from 
the MMR group. From baseline to a median follow-up of 9·8 years, 76 (3%) children in the MMRV group, 469 (21%) 
in the MMR + V group, and 352 (47%) in the MMR group had varicella. Vaccine efficacy against all varicella was 
95·4% (95% CI 94·0–96·4) for MMRV and 67·2% (62·3–71·5) for MMR + V; vaccine efficacy against moderate or 
severe varicella was 99·1% (97·9–99·6) for MMRV and 89·5% (86·1–92·1) for MMR + V. During phase b, 
serious adverse events were reported by 290 (15%) of 1961 children in the MMRV group, 317 (16%) of 1978 in the 
MMR + V group, and 93 (15%) of 641 in the MMR group. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Interpretation The 10-years vaccine efficacy observed, suggests that a two-dose schedule of varicella vaccine provided 
optimum long-term protection for the prevention of varicella by offering individual protection against all severities of 
disease and leading to a potential reduction in transmission, as observed in the US experience with universal mass 
vaccination.

In the control group, at year 6, there were still 79 children
(44.9%) seronegative for anti-VZV antibodies and these children
remaining susceptible to VZV infection/disease. The increase in
GMC overtime in the control group despite post-infection data
being considered missing indicates that there is a degree of under-
reporting of varicella cases or subjects are experiencing subclinical
varicella infection. If this proportion is generalized to the entire
remaining control group, an efﬁcacy estimate at 10 years is
expected to be informative.
From 3 to 6 years post-vaccination no safety concerns were
identiﬁed, with none of the SAEs being assessed by the investiga-
tors as vaccine-related. These results support the vaccines’ known
clinically acceptable safety proﬁles [21].
The strengths of this trial, conferring it robustness, are its
multinational and multiyear design, the inclusion of a control
group, its rigorous case conﬁrmation procedures, and the fact

Introduction
Varicella is a highly contagious disease caused by the 
varicella zoster virus (VZV). Universal vaccination with 
live-attenuated varicella vaccine in the USA since 1995, 
and Uruguay since 1999, has substantially reduced the 
incidence of varicella and related admissions to hospital 
and deaths.1–3 However, breakthrough varicella occurs in 
children vaccinated with one dose.4 In 2007, a two-dose 
live varicella-vaccine schedule was recommended by 
the USA’s Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices.5 This schedule could include a live monovalent 
varicella vaccine, or a combination measles-mumps-
rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV).5
Countries considering implementation of universal 
varicella immunisation must decide whether to offer one 
or two doses, the timing of a second dose, and whether to 
use MMRV as a potential way to enhance compliance.6,7 
MMRV vaccines have been licensed with two-dose 
schedules in most European countries on the basis of 
comparative immunogenicity to monovalent varicella 
vaccines only.6 No differences in anti-VZV immuno­
genicity have been identified between MMRV and

Abstract
Background and methods: measles is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Although the
measles–mumps–rubella vaccine (MMR) is currently in use in developed countries, monovalent measles vaccine (MV) is routinely
recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) at 9 months of age in Turkey, as in many other developing countries. In
this study, 442 Turkish children received MV at 9 months of age and were revaccinated with MMR vaccine at 15 months of age.
In the second group 495 children received MMR at 12 months of age with no earlier measles vaccination. Antibodies were
measured before the ﬁrst vaccination and 6 weeks after the MMR. All children had been followed for occurrence of measles
infection for 60 months. Two vaccination schedules were compared for immunogenicity and protection rates. Conclusions:
seroconversion and clinical protection rates were signiﬁcantly higher in children who received only MMR at 12 months of age
than in children revaccinated at 15 months of age. Seroconversion rate for measles was 69.9% in children who received MMR at
12 months of age and 90.3% in children revaccinated at 15 months of age (P=0.0003)."
17,aa-Povey (2019).pdf,0.9049832738883203,"This phase 3 RCT assessed two doses of MMRV or one dose of 
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) + one dose of varicella 
vaccine (MMR+V) compared with two doses of MMR (control), 
and at the 3-year follow-up showed that, compared with 
control vaccine, the efficacy of the two-dose MMRV schedule 
was 94·9%, the efficacy of the one-dose varicella vaccine 
schedule was 65·4% against all varicella. The 6-year follow-up 
showed that, compared with control vaccine, the efficacy of 
two doses of MMRV against all varicella was 95·0%, and of 
one dose was 67·0%. These efficacy estimates support the use 
of two doses of MMRV over the one-dose varicella vaccine 
schedule for protection against varicella disease for up to 
6 years after vaccination in healthy children.
Added value of this study
Further to the analyses at years 3 and 6, this long-term 
follow-up provides descriptive efficacy estimates for varicella 
vaccine in children aged 10–11 years. The vaccine efficacy 
estimates over 10 years showed that compared with control 
vaccine, for two-dose MMRV the efficacy against all varicella 
was 95·4%, and for one dose of varicella vaccine was 67·2%. 
That is, in a setting where varicella is endemic among children 
allowing for natural boosting, compared with control vaccine, 
the two-dose MMRV schedule provided higher protection 
throughout 10 years than one dose of varicella vaccine against 
all severities of varicella disease.
Implications of all available evidence
The effectiveness of various varicella vaccines for protection 
against varicella disease in children has been widely established 
in countries which include varicella in routine childhood 
vaccination programmes. In addition, the benefits of combined 
MMRV over separate injections of MMR+V are well established, 
and include simpler delivery of vaccines, increased compliance, 
and reduced health-care costs. The clinical evidence shows 
that a two-dose schedule of live varicella MMRV provides robust 
long-term protection against varicella disease in young children."

DISCUSSION 
The availability of effective trivalent vaccines has im- 
portant implications in achieving successful immunization 
programs. Besides being more economical, the trivalent 
vaccines permit fuller vaccine coverage in the segments of 
the populations which have been traditionally hard to 
immunize. Reduction in the number of visits required for 
immunization makes this possible. 
Measles, mumps, and rubella live-virus vaccines are 
generally considered to be less than fully effective in 
children less than one year old because of the occasional 
persistence of maternal antibodies. In this study, 29 11- 
month-old triple-susceptible triple vaccinees gave sero- 
conversion rates and GMT's within the ranges to be ex- 
pected from older children receiving the same vaccines 
alone or combined. However, this number of infant 
vaccinees is too small to justify advocating administration 
of this trivalent vaccine prior to one year of age. There- 
fore, this vaccine should not be given to children under 
Volume 87

one year of age unless required by epidemic conditions. 
Infants thus vaccinated should be revaccinated after they 
have attained one year of age unless an antibody response 
to the earlier vaccination can be documented. 
A trivalent measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, M-M-R, 
has been available for more than two years. The trivalent 
vaccine we evaluated has been recently licensed and 
provides physicians with a choice of product. The two 
vaccines differ in the strains of measles and rubella, but 
utilize similar dosage of all three components. The tri- 
valent vaccines have resulted in adequate antibody 
response; little reactivity, and indications for persistence 
of antibody similar to the monovalent vaccines?

During a mean follow-up of about 3 years, the attack 
rate in the control group was of 10·4 per 100 person-years

Summary 
The vast majority of adverse reactions
following immunisation of children with
live measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine were shown in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 581
twin pairs to be only temporally but not causally related to the
vaccination. The true frequency of side-effects caused by
MMR vaccine, estimated from the discordance rates of
individual signs and symptoms between MMR 
vaccinees and
their placebo-injected twins, was between 0&middot;5 and 4&middot;0%.
Moreover, respiratory symptoms, nausea, and vomiting were
observed more frequently in the placebo-injected group than
in the MMR vaccinated group.
Introduction
A VACCINATION programme to eliminate measles, mumps,
and rubella (MMR) from Finland began in 1982.’ The live
combined vaccine (’Virivac’, Merck Sharp & Dohme)2-5 is
administered in two doses, the first at age 14-18 months and
the second at 6 years. In the early stages of the programme,
however, children between these age limits are also being
immunised.
One of the major concerns in any large-scale vaccination
programme is the occurrence of adverse reactions. The
measles component6-9 and, to a lesser extent, the rubella
antigen 10, 11 are known to be reactogenic, whereas the mumps
component is thought to be almost harmless.12-15 Few
studies 3,15,16 have compared common symptoms and signs
occurring in vaccinees and controls. In particular, little
attention has been paid to reactions caused by the combined
MMR vaccine."
26,aa-Povey (2019).pdf,0.9013922089180793,"At 10 years, the proportions 
of children who were seropositive for varicella zoster 
virus (≥25 mIU/mL) were 99·6% in the MMRV group 
and 98·4% and MMR + V group, and the proportions of 
children with varicella zoster virus titres of at least 
50 mIU/mL were 98·0% and 93·7%, respectively, 
suggesting that long-term natural exposure to varicella 
zoster virus had a modest boosting effect in the one-dose 
MMR + V group.
The previously reported safety profiles of the vaccines 
during the follow-up at 2 years were consistent with the 
established profile of combined MMRV and monovalent 
live attenuated varicella vaccines.22–25 Within 15 days of 
dose one, fever of 38°C or more and grade 3 fever were 
more frequent in the MMRV group than the other 
vaccine groups, which is in line with various studies that 
have reported an increased risk of febrile seizures after 
the first dose of MMRV compared with separate 
MMR + V, although the risk is relatively low.7,26–29 Our 
study was not powered to detect increased risk of febrile 
seizures. From the start of phase b to 10 years post 
vaccination, the proportions of serious adverse events 
were similar between the vaccine groups (14·5–16·0%), 
and none of the serious adverse events were considered 
vaccine-related by the investigator. During phase a+b, 
14 children withdrew from the study because of a serious 
adverse event, including leukaemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, 
lymphadenopathy, and thrombocytopenia."
27,aa-Povey (2019).pdf,0.9012234564516693,"Three lots each of MMRV 
and monovalent varicella vaccine and one lot of 
MMR control vaccine were used. During phase b, the 
study remained observer blind (including parents and 
guardians) for all groups except the MMR + V group in 
countries where the national vaccination schedule 
includes a second dose of MMR vaccination at age 
4–8 years (Czech Republic, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, 
Russia, and Sweden). The independent data monitoring 
committee remained masked to the study treatment 
group when assessing varicella cases.
Outcomes
The outcomes for phase b were secondary and descriptive. 
The efficacy outcomes were to assess vaccine efficacy of 
two doses of MMRV or one dose of MMR + one dose of 
varicella vaccine versus two doses of MMR control vaccine 
against varicella at 10 years after vaccination, and vaccine 
efficacy of MMRV or MMR + V for the prevention of 
varicella according to the severity of varicella cases. The 
immunogenicity outcomes at 10 years were to assess the 
proportions of varicella zoster virus seropositivity, geo­
metric mean titres, and geometric mean concentrations 
of varicella zoster virus antibodies. Measles, mumps, and 
rubella antibody titres in a subset of children at years 4, 6, 
8, and 10 will be presented elsewhere. The long-term 
safety outcome was to describe serious adverse events 
and cases of herpes zoster.
The burden of illness was assessed among parents 
and guardians who had a child with confirmed 
varicella, including: time lost from work as a result of 
caring for their child; time their child lost for daily 
activities (attendance at daycare, child minders, school, 
extra-​curricular activities); time when assistance was 
needed to care for their child with varicella (nurse, 
babysitter, paid caregiver); and whether they would 
have contacted or visited a physician to seek advice for 
varicella if their child were not participating in the 
trial.
Parents were asked to seek assessment if their child or 
a member of their household had any rash or illness 
resembling varicella or herpes zoster, and a detailed 
description of the rash was recorded."

Illness after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination
Thomas R. Freeman, MD, CCFP; Moira A. Stewart, PhD; Linda Turner, MEd
Objectives: To provide accurate information on the common sequelae of measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccination and to compare postvaccine symptoms in children vaccinated
at 13 and 15 months.
Design: Prospective cluster randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Twenty-two family practices in southwestem Ontario.
Patients: All 376 infants who were due to receive MMR vaccine in the next year; 253
(67.3%) successfully completed the study.
Intervention: MMR vaccine administered at 13 months by half of the family physicians and
at 15 months by the remaining half.
Outcome measures: Family physician's physical findings in children 7 days and 30 days af-
ter vaccine; reported illnesses by mothers in a daily diary in the month before and after vacci-
nation and medical records of visits to family physicians and hospital admissions in the
month before and after vaccination.
Results: Compared with the incidence rates in the corresponding weeks before vaccination,
the rates of lymphadenopathy (23.8%) and fever (16.8%) were higher 1 week afterward and
the rate of rash (26.9%) was higher 7 to 14 days afterward. Fewer health problems were re-
ported in the third and fourth weeks after vaccination than in the corresponding weeks be-
forehand. Hospital admissions after vaccination were no more frequent than those before
once cause and time of admission were taken into account. The two age groups did not differ
in any of the outcomes.
Conclusions: Mothers should be informed about the possibility of increased physical find-
ings in the weeks after MMR vaccination, especially lymphadenopathy, nasal discharge and
rash. Since the occurrence of sequelae does not seem to differ significantly between 13-
month-old recipients and 15-month-old recipients, it should not influence the decision of
when to administer the vaccine.

This is consistent with phase a of the study, where at

MMRV against all varicella cases was 94·9% and for 
one dose of varicella vaccine was 65·4%. Our 10-year 
vaccine efficacy estimates suggest that the short two-dose 
MMRV schedule provided optimum long-term protection 
for the prevention of all varicella, although both the 
MMRV and MMR + V schedules were effective, with 
MMRV preventing moderate or severe varicella at 99·1%

In phase a, the vaccine efficacy estimates supported the 
use of the short two-dose MMRV schedule over the one-
dose MMR + V schedule, although it was not known 
whether the vaccines offered long-term protection or 
delayed the appearance of moderate or severe disease. 
Previous studies have shown that cases of varicella are 
milder in severity for children who are vaccinated than 
for those who are unvaccinated, although the incidence 
of varicella is reported to increase from 1 year to up to 
10 years post vaccination.19,20 In the MMRV and MMR + V 
groups, respectively, during the first 3 years of follow-up, 
the rates of varicella were 0·6 per 100 person-years

A Randomised Single Blind Trial of a Combined 
Mumps Measles Rubella Vaccine to Evaluate 
Serological Response and Reactions in the UK 
Population

Four hundred and twenty children were randomly assigned to receive either mumps 
measles rubella (MMR) vaccine (207) or measles vaccine (213) in a single blind study, to 
investigate the reactogenicity and serology of the MMR vaccine. There was no 
significant difference between the number of children developing symptoms after MM R 
vaccination to those developing symptoms after measles vaccination. Both vaccines are 
associated with a rash, temperature and restlessness five to thirteen days after vaccina- 
tion. The serological response to measles vaccine was similar in both groups with 92-6% 
seroconverting with MMR, and 96-8% with measles. Seroconvertion against mumps 
and rubella with the MMR vaccine was 88% and 96% respectively. This study confirms 
the safety and efficacy of the MMR vaccine in a UK population. 
Introduction 
The mumps measles rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced into the UK vaccination 
schedule in October 1988. ~ 
It is hoped that this change in immunisation policy will boost vaccination rates against 
measles towards the 90% uptake target for 1990 suggested by the WHO and lead ultimately 
to the erradication of measles, mumps and rubella. 
The MMR vaccine has been available in America since the 1970s, and Scandinavia since 
1982. 2 There are many data from these countries concerning the vaccine. The majority of 
these studies used vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn (mumps) and Moraten (measles) virus 
strains. 3'4's In the UK we are also using Urabe AM/9 (mumps) Schwarz (measles) 
combination. This combination has been compared to Jeryl Lynn-Moraten vaccine, and 
found to be at least equally immunogenic and reactogenic."

among children who received two doses of MMRV or 
one dose of MMR + V.
During the one-dose varicella vaccination era in the 
USA (1996–2005), the incidence of varicella cases 
decreased by about 90%, hospitalisation for varicella 
disease by 88%, and deaths due to varicella disease 
decreased by more than 65%, when compared with 1995. 
Further declines in varicella incidence and related 
hospitalisations have been observed since switching to the 
two-dose schedule in 2006. The proportion of cases of 
varicella reported in children with immunocompromising 
conditions also decreased significantly in the two-dose era 
when compared with the one-dose era.30 The rapid 
implementation of vaccination against varicella in other 
countries, including Uruguay, Australia, Canada, and 
Germany, has also shown a substantial decrease in the 
incidence and severity of varicella infections in children.1–3,31 
However, because varicella is usually perceived as a mild 
disease in children, vaccination is not a priority for many 
state-funded programmes, even though mild cases 
represent an economic burden due to the disruption of a 
child’s activities, reduced work productivity among 
parents and guardians, and the use of health-care 
services.31 In countries that have adopted vaccination 
against varicella, routine childhood vaccination is reported 
to be cost-effective from a health-care perspective and a 
societal perspective.31
In each of the vaccine groups in our study, about 40% of 
parents and guardians of children with confirmed 
varicella reported losing time from work and about 
75% reported that their child missed regular activities 
such as nursery or school."

LIVE ATTENUATED VIRUS VACCINES can be admin- 
istered simultaneously without increase in reactivity or 
diminution in immunologic responses? Recently, a 
second measles, mumps, and rubella trivalent vaccine has 
been licensed. This study describes the reactivity and 
immunologic efficacy.of this newer trivalent vaccine. 
MATERIALS 
AND METHODS 
Vaccine. The vaccine was a combination of Schwarz 
strain live, attenuated measles virus, 2 Jeryl Lynn strain 
five, attenuated mumps virus? and Cendehill strain live, 
and attenuated rubella virus? Three different production 
lots were used in this study. All lots contained at least 
1,000 50% tissue culture infective doses of measles and 
rubella viruses and 5,000 TCIDs0 of mumps virus. The 
trivalent vaccine was dispensed into single dose vials, 
lyophilized, and stored at 5~ until administered. 
Placebo. The placebo used in the study was identical to 
the vaccine in all respects except it did not contain 
virus. 
Serology. All serologic assays were performed in the 
Assay Laboratory of The Dow Chemical Company in 
Zionsville, Indiana. Antibodies to measles and rubella 
viruses were determined by the hemagglutination inhibi- 
tion method in microtiter plates?, 6 Four units of hemag- 
glutination antigen were used; the end point was taken as 
the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited

considered (with the additional search term “clinical trial”) on the basis that they reported

Interpretation
As far as we are aware, this study is the first randomised concurrently controlled trial in 
healthy children aged 12–22 months, assessing the multiyear efficacy of a live varicella 
vaccine, formulated either as a monovalent vaccine or combined with MMR vaccine, on 
the basis of active surveillance for rash illness of any intensity with rigorous case 
confirmation. The results from this study confirm the highly efficacious protection 
afforded by two doses of MMRV given over 6 weeks against varicella of any intensity. They 
also support the highly efficacious protection afforded by one dose of monovalent varicella 
vaccine against typical varicella disease (moderate to severe), although prevention of mild 
breakthrough varicella was not as high as that afforded by two doses of MMRV.

from that assessed for ProQuad. Overall, no new clinically 
important safety signals were identified and the results are 
supportive of an acceptable safety profile of the MMRV, 
monovalent varicella vaccine, and MMR schedules in 
healthy children during their second year of life.
The strengths of this study compared with previous 
assessments of VZV vaccine efficacy were its use of a 
randomised control group, active surveillance, and 
stringent procedures for case confirmation. All these 
measures were designed to achieve a robust estimate 
of vaccine efficacy, including against even mild break­
through disease. Case confirmation by epidemiological 
link afforded increased sensitivity for case detection in 
situations where the VZV-PCR result was negative or 
unobtainable. The greater reliance on an epidemiological 
link for confirming cases in the MMRV group most 
probably resulted from the mildness of the disease."
36,aa-Henry (2018).pdf,0.8961514739255068,"The fact that active surveillance was done to identify vari-
cella cases and that a blinded adjudication committee was used
to assess suspected cases are also strong points. Some of its
limitations include loss to follow-up over the cohort’s periods,
racial homogeneity of the children, not all cases being presented
(and even when presented no systematic picture record) and
unblinding of some children in the MMR+V group (could be
biased if parents brought children with rash illness to medical
attention).
Our data suggest that implementation of two-dose varicella
vaccination in children during their second year of life ensures
optimum protection against all forms of varicella disease.
5. Conclusions
The efﬁcacy of two doses of MMRV and one dose of MMR+V per-
sisted through >6 years post-vaccination, with two doses of MMRV
being highly efﬁcacious against varicella of any severity and one
dose of MMR+V being highly efﬁcacious against moderate/severe
disease with moderate protection against milder disease. No safety
issues were identiﬁed.

Clinical evaluation of a new measles-mumps-

Over 900 children were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study of
measles (Schwarz strain), mumps (Jeryl Lynn strain), and rubella (Cendehill strain)
trivalent vaccine. The trivalent vaccine caused about the same degree of reactivity as is
generally associated with the Schwarz strain measles vaccine. Paired sera from triple-
susceptible vaccinees had seroconversion rates of 99 % for measles, 94 % for mumps, and
93 % for rubella. The results ofthis study show that this trivalent vacci-le is as well tolerated
and as effective as its component vaccines.
The growing list of virus diseases becoming ame-
nable to control by vaccination necessitates improve-
ments in the system for delivery of this type of
preventive medical care. The efficiency of immuniza-
tion programmes, both private and public, can be
greatly increased by the use of polyvalent vaccines
provided that the individual components were all
intended for the same populations. The polyvalent
combinations should be no more reactive and no less
effective than the components used singly. For live,
attenuated virus vaccines, both the practical and
technical requirements have been met by a variety of
double and triple combinations (1, 2) each prepared
for use in certain countries or populations.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was con-
ducted to evaluate clinically a new measles-mumps-
rubella trivalent live virus vaccine. Consultation with
health authorities in the Dominican Republic re-
vealed that country to be an appropriate site for a
project of this type. In intercity and rural popula-

Study design
This phase 3b study was an observer-blind, controlled, 
assessment of children aged 12–22 months who were 
randomly assigned (3:3:1) to receive two doses of MMRV, 
one dose of MMR followed by one dose of V, or two doses 
of MMR control vaccine, 42 days apart. The study 
comprised two distinct surveillance periods: phase a and 
b. Phase a + b began 6 weeks after dose two and ended at 
the last visit in phase b (year 10), covering the overall 
10 years of the study, whereas phase b started, on 
average, 3 years after vaccination and ended at the last 
visit in phase b. An overview of the study design is shown 
in the appendix.
The study was done in Czech Republic (Czechia), Italy, 
Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, 
Slovakia, and Sweden (NCT00226499). A protocol 
summary is available. The follow-ups at years 3 and 6

Participants
Children aged 12–22 months were eligible for inclusion if 
they had not received MMR or varicella vaccines, or both, 
or had measles-mumps-rubella or varicella zoster or 
herpes zoster diseases, or both, and were at home with at 
least one sibling with negative history of varicella disease 
and vaccination, at a child-minders where at least one child 
was without a known positive history of varicella disease 
and vaccination, playing for more than 5 min/week with 
children without a known positive history of varicella 
disease and vaccination, or registered to attend day care 
from 24 months. All parents and guardians gave informed 
written consent for participation.
The study was done in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki and International Harmonization Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was reviewed 
and approved by an independent ethics committees or 
institutional review board in all participating countries. 
Protocol deviations have been previously published.11
Randomisation and masking
The vaccines assessed were MMRV (Priorix-Tetra, 
GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]), MMR (Priorix, GSK), and 
monovalent varicella (V; Varilrix, GSK). Randomisation 
and blinding have been previously described.11 Briefly, 
children were randomly assigned (3:3:1) to receive 
two doses of MMRV at days 0 and 42 (MMRV group); 
one dose of MMR at day 0 and one dose of varicella 
vaccine at day 42 (MMR + V group), or two doses of MMR 
vaccine as control at days 0 and 42.
Procedures
Vaccines were administered subcutaneously in the 
deltoid of the child’s left arm. Three lots each of MMRV 
and monovalent varicella vaccine and one lot of 
MMR control vaccine were used."

nine years after vaccination was lack of statistical power and the 
small sample size (2 vaccinated cases) might be a contributing 
factor.
MMR or MM vaccine has been included in the National 
Immunization Program in China in 2008. That is to say, eligible 
children aged 8–24 mo are able to mainly receive free domestic 
MMR or MM vaccine for preventing mumps. However, the 
vaccinations among children older than 2 y have to be paid by 
their guardians. Consequently, the mumps vaccination coverage 
may increase dramatically since 2008 among children 8–24 mo. 
The mumps incidence rate among children of 3–12 y old may be 
higher than other age groups, since this cohort was not “eligible” 
for vaccination under the prior National Immunization Program. 
Some parents may choose international vaccines for their children 
(8–24 mo) even if the extra charges, because they would believe 
that international vaccines may provide better protection than the 
domestic vaccines. As a result, vaccine type is highly correlated 
with age at vaccination, the younger children may be likely to 
receive domestic vaccines rather than international vaccines, 
and the older children would receive both kind of vaccines. 
Due to the 63.7% missing of the manufacture information in 
the electronic system, the small sample size in the study made it 
hard to conduct separately by vaccine type to address whether VE 
wanes over time, we only addressed it in general.
The 1 dose VE for Jeryl Lynn-containing mumps vaccine 
ranges from 49–88% (median: 77%).6,7 There is dearth of 
studies that have examined vaccine effectiveness exclusively 
for mumps vaccines containing the RIT 4385 strain although 
there are several published studies that include individuals who 
received the RIT 4385 strain mumps vaccine.8,9 The VE for the 
RIT 4385 strain is expected to be similar to the Jeryl-Lynn strain 
as it is a derivative of the Jery1-Lynn strain."

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Several countries recommend the universal vaccination of 
children against varicella using monovalent varicella 
vaccine (V), given together with other childhood vaccines at 
separate injection sites, or as a combined 
measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV). A PubMed 
search on May 15, 2018, of “MMRV” identified three systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses, among which the most up-to-date 
was a meta-analysis of the effectiveness, immunogenicity and 
safety of one-dose versus two-dose varicella vaccination, based 
on studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and June 30, 2017. 
The meta-analysis showed that the two-dose varicella 
vaccination schedule was more immunogenic and more 
effective at preventing varicella disease than one dose of 
varicella vaccine. For two doses versus one dose of varicella 
vaccine, vaccine effectiveness increased by 79% in randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs), 63% in cohort studies, and 81% in 
case-control studies. Direct evidence for a protective effect was 
provided by two RCTs that compared the vaccine efficacy of 
one-dose and two-dose varicella vaccine schedules. The 
first RCT to compare the dosing schedules was done before 
varicella vaccine was licensed in 1995, meaning that disease 
exposure and transmission was high. In the most recent RCT 
to provide efficacy data on varicella vaccines, children were 
enrolled and vaccinated between Sept 1, 2005, and 
May 10, 2006, in countries with endemic varicella among 
children and with no recommendation for varicella vaccination."

one dose MMR vaccine group may be related to sea-
sonal variations of vaccination.
In conclusion, seroconversion and clinical protec-
tion of MV at early ages and revaccination at or
after one year of age may differ between countries
depending on the maternal antibody status. The elim-
ination time of maternal antibodies might be related
to vaccine coverage and infection prevalence of moth-
ers and may vary in different geographic locations.
Since most of the mothers who live in developing
countries have high measles antibody levels gained by
infection, their children were expected to lose mater-
nal measles antibodies later than children of devel-
oped countries.

46,ba‐Castilla-2 (2009).pdf,0.8911604629809847,"The analysis limited only to children vaccinated with two doses
showed that the risk of mumps was higher with increasing time
since the last dose of MMR vaccine (Table 4). Those who had
received the second dose 3 or more years before study enrolment
had a higher risk of mumps than those who had received the second
dose within the last 3 years (OR = 10.19; 95% CI 1.47–70.73). Another
well-adjusted model was obtained using the square of time since
the second dose, in years, as a continuous variable (OR per square
year 1.22; 95% CI 1.02–1.46).
4. Discussion
In children age 1–10 years we found the MMR vaccine contain-
ing the Jeryl Lynn strain to be 72% effective in preventing cases of
mumps. The effectiveness was 66% for one dose and reached 83%
after the second dose. These results are similar to the ranges of effec-
tiveness found in previous studies conducted in outbreak settings
[8–10,14–16], although some of these studies analysed adolescents
and young adults for whom the time since vaccination was much
longer. Since the birth of the study children, there had been scarcely
any mumps virus in circulation in Navarre, therefore previous nat-
ural immunity or the booster of the vaccine effect by asymptomatic
infections was highly unlikely. Between August 2006 and July 2008
the virus came into general circulation, as shown by the fact that
1% of the population under age 30 was affected despite high vacci-
nation coverage. It can thus be afﬁrmed that a large portion of the
population, including the controls, would probably also have been
exposed to the infection during this outbreak.
Possible explanations for the moderate effectiveness of the vac-
cine are primary vaccine failure, loss of secondary effectiveness, and
infection by heterologous viruses [17–20].
Primary vaccine failure could be due to problems with vaccine
conservation and to failure of the immune response. However, fol-
lowing the guidelines for maintaining and managing the vaccine
cold chain, when any relevant problem was detected all affected
doses were discarded [21]."

In this study, to minimise bias of symptom reporting, the parents were not informed 
which vaccine their child had received. Ideally one would use a placebo control group but 
we felt it unethical to do so in an invasive study, and opted to compare the new vaccine 
(MMR) with the one it has replaced (measles). 
Many parents reported their children to have symptoms. This high illness level occurred 
throughout the six-week period, and involved nasopharyngeal and gastrointestinal 
symptoms. There was no temporal relationship to vaccination. This probably represents 
background illness and is in agreement with the findings of Vesikari et al. 6 
A symptom complex of rash, fever and restlessness in the second week of vaccination is a 
well-recognised reaction to measles vaccination. Sixty per cent of our study were affected by 
one of these symptoms: this is quite high, but is in accordance with other workers who have 
shown between 30 and 40% to be affected by fever following measles vaccination. 6J'~° A 
more accurate assessment of true adverse reaction is thought to be that of Petola and 
Heinonen in their study using a placebo group. 3 As far as possible we tried to create the 
conditions of the routine use of the vaccine. However, although parental anxiety may well 
be higher in study conditions, it is our impression that most parents will observe their child 
closely following vaccination. Thus, though the rate of adverse reaction we report may not 
be the true reaction rate, it is the rate perceived by parents. We have found this rate to be 
similar for both MMR and measles vaccination. Health workers should be aware that mild 
and self-limiting reactions are common after most vaccinations so that parents are fully 
informed and can be adequately reassured. The reactions are similar to those after the 
measles vaccine alone. 
Parotitis associated with mumps vaccination occurred in 2.5% of our study. This is 
higher than has previously been reported in the majority of other studies using Jeryl Lynn 
mumps vaccine. The Oxford study ~r (using the same vaccine as this study) reported an 
incidence of 1%. In view of the low incidence and small numbers of the studies, the 
differences observed in rates are probably not significant."

is vaccination with 2 doses of the trivalent measles, mumps,
and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vaccine uptake of at least 95%
with 2 doses of MMR is considered to be necessary to achieve
elimination.1
Although the objective of disease elimination in the Euro-
pean Region by 2010 was established, 120 outbreaks were reported
in 2005 to 2008, 17 of which had more than 250 cases, and there
were 25 deaths.2
If given within 72 hours of exposure to measles, immuni-
zation is the intervention of choice for the control of measles
outbreaks in schools and child care centers.1,3 However, the
studies on which this recommendation is based are old and difﬁcult
to replicate.4,5 More recent studies suggest that administering the
MMR vaccine within 72 hours does not avoid the appearance of
new cases.6,7
In Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain, a measles
outbreak occurred between August 2006 and June 2007 causing
381 cases, mainly in infants aged 15 months.8 The vaccination
schedule at that time ﬁxed the age of administration of 2 doses of
vaccine at 15 months and 4 years. The objective of this study was
to determine the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the MMR vaccine
as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in school children, taking into
account different time periods from exposure to vaccination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We carried out a retrospective cohort study. The study
population comprised children attending child-care centers and
schools of the Barcelona-South Health Region (population
2,853,658 inhabitants) which a conﬁrmed case of measles had
attended during the infectious period.
A conﬁrmed case of measles was a laboratory-conﬁrmed
case (positive serology for measles immunoglobulin M antibody
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing or positive poly-
merase chain reaction for measles virus in urine sample) or a case
that met the World Health Organization clinical case deﬁnition and
was epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-conﬁrmed case."

Vaccination was deferred in any child who had been in contact with measles, mumps or 
rubella in the previous three weeks, had a febrile illness, had received gamma globulin in the 
previous three months or had received a vaccine in the previous month. 
The child was randomly assigned to receive MMR vaccine or measles vaccine by a system 
of sealed number envelopes, the numbers corresponding to the child's study number. 
Randomization occurred at the time of vaccination in the Child Health Clinic. 
The vaccination was given in the upper arm, unless the parents objected in which case it 
was given in the upper leg. Prior to vaccination 1.5 ml of venous blood was taken into a dry 
tube. Parents were given a diary and asked to record any symptoms in the child, whether or 
not they thought them attributable to the vaccination. The diary asked specifically if the 
child had: anything to see at the injection site, sore arm, pain anywhere, a rash, a fever, or if 
they had received medication. There was also a space to record if the child was different 
from usual and in what way. The diary was completed daily for three weeks. The parents 
were asked to continue to monitor their child for a further three weeks and record any 
symptoms weekly in the diary. After six weeks the diaries were collected and any symptoms 
discussed with the parents. A second blood sample was taken at this time for serology. The 
trial code was broken and the parents informed which vaccine the child had received. If the 
child had received only measles vaccine they were offered mumps (Immovax) and rubella 
(Rudivax) vaccinations. 
The information from the diaries was categorised into symptom groups: 
1. Local symptoms: erythema, induration, pain. 
2. General specific symptoms; rash, parotitis, testicular swelling, arthralgia, arthritis, 
conjunctival inflammation, convulsion. 
3. General non-specific symptoms; fever, adenopathy, nasopharyngeal inflammation, 
digestive disorders, restlessness."

many countries, the increased incidence of childhood autism was
initially linked with the launching of MMR vaccination cam-
paigns. This study was unable to conﬁrm the Wakeﬁeld et al
hypothesis, ﬁnding a lower risk of developing autism for
children vaccinated against measles, with the lowest risk being
found for children vaccinated with MMR. Our study partici-
pants were not evaluated for the presence of the measles virus
in their gastrointestinal tracts. Other previously published study
found strong evidence against the association of autism with
persistent measles virus RNA in gastrointestinal tracts exposed
to the MMR vaccine.14
The ﬁndings of our study concerning the single-antigen
measles vaccine cannot be compared with other reports, as no
similar study has been previously published. Other studies exam-
ined sample populations vaccinated exclusively with MMR, as the
triple vaccine program was launched much earlier in those coun-
tries, than in Poland. Yet this study was still able to reach
conclusions similar to previously published studies, conﬁrming
that MMR is not associated with an increased risk of autism. Odds
ratios obtained in this study were similar to those obtained by other
authors.15–17
The decreased risk of autism among vaccinated children
may be due to some other confounding factors in their health
status. For example, healthcare workers or parents may have
noticed signs of developmental delay or disease before the actual
autism diagnosis and for this reason have avoided vaccination.
A heterogeneous population of children vaccinated with
MMR or exclusively against measles is a strength of our study.
First, such a study population offers the opportunity to evaluate
those vaccinated with MMR and the single measles variety for the
risk of autism. Second, it allowed for examining whether the risk
of being diagnosed with autism differed between these 2 vaccines.
Participants’ vaccination histories were taken directly from
physician’s records, eliminating the potential for recall bias. Be-
cause they are surveyed by independent public health workers at
least twice per year, Polish vaccination records are very reliable.
Introducing the MMR vaccine as a replacement for the
single-antigen measles vaccine in the mandatory vaccination
schedule improved vaccination coverage against measles in Po-
land."

lowing the guidelines for maintaining and managing the vaccine
cold chain, when any relevant problem was detected all affected

cases to be especially concentrated in children vaccinated with a
particular batch, nor in those vaccinated at the same time and place.
The lower response in vaccinated children as a function of age, espe-
cially before 12 months, has been described [17]. We found that
administration of the ﬁrst dose of MMR vaccine after the third year
of life was associated with lower protection. These late vaccinations
sometimes occur when missed vaccinations are brought up to date,
a situation in which the MMR vaccine is frequently co-administered
with other vaccines. However, our results do not permit any con-
clusion about the relation between simultaneous vaccination and
loss of effectiveness.

Introduction
Childhood vaccinations recommended around the world are
based on the scientiﬁc principle of their preventive and protec-
tive effect. An appropriate well-planned vaccination card, based
on scientiﬁc evidence, could bring great beneﬁt by reducing
morbidity and mortality in high and low income countries.1
Vaccines may have a ‘non-speciﬁc’ protective effect on mor-
bidity and mortality due to diseases not susceptible to vaccina-
tion, as demonstrated by different types of studies, both
observational and clinical trials performed in low income coun-
tries,2-8 for example as in the case of the beneﬁcial effects of
non-speciﬁc measles and tuberculosis vaccines (BCG); on the
contrary, the inactivated vaccines, such as those against diph-
theria and tetanus,9 polio10 and hepatitis B,11 have been associ-
ated with different mortality rates between man and women.
Measles, mumps, and rubella are typical childhood infectious
diseases, highly contagious, and yet despite this generally have a
good prognosis, though they may lead to serious complications
and cause an avoidable burden on the health care system.12
The measles infection causes immune depression for about 6
weeks.13 The complications (otitis, pneumonia, bronchitis) that
occur in approximately 30% of cases, may arise especially in
this period of time. One particularly feared and dangerous
complication can be post-infectious encephalitis, while a
particularly serious long-term consequence is represented by
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), often fatal.12
The best known complications of mumps infection instead
are: meningitis, orchitis, and pancreatitis. There have been rare
cases of unilateral deafness. Orchitis occurs in about 25% of
men infected after puberty and, in the case of bilateral orchitis,
may result in infertility."

confirmed varicella were reported in the MMRV group, 
one severe confirmed case in the MMR + V group (<1%), 
and six severe cases in the MMR control group (1%).
Among the children who developed varicella disease in 
the MMRV and MMR + V groups during the follow-up 
period, the majority had 50 lesions or fewer (MMRV 
88%, MMR + V 76%). By comparison, 36% of those with 
confirmed varicella disease in the MMR control group 
exhibited one to 50 lesions and the majority had more 
than 50 lesions (32% with 51–100 lesions, 28% with 
101–500 lesions, and 4% with >500 lesions). The monthly 
distribution of confirmed varicella cases showed higher 
proportions of varicella cases in the autumn, winter, and 
spring, compared with summer, with almost no cases 
reported in August. This seasonal distribution is clear in 
the MMR control group and MMR + V group, but less so 
in the MMRV group because of the very low number of 
reported cases (appendix)."

documented.1-3.6.8-11 Giving these licensed
monovalent products to millions of children’

dence of their safety and efficacy.
The main purposes of the present study
were to detect whether any special symptoms
might result from these vaccines in combina-
tion and to observe whether any increase
might occur in either frequency or severity
of mild side effects known to be associated
These observations indicate that there is
neither viral nor immunologic interference
between any of the components of the
trivalent vaccine.
with the individual components. Symptoms
such as fever, rash, arthritis, arthralgia, and
parotitis were of particular interest. The ob-
servations made in this study show the vaccine
components to be comparible in vzvo with re-
spect both to efficacy and to freedom from
undesirable reactions.
Some of the observed fevers and rashes
may have been vaccine-induced, but the
frequency of these known minor reactions to
measles and rubella vaccines did not seem
enhanced when these vaccines were given in
a trivalent mixture with mumps vaccine.
Similarly, the nonoccurrence of other symp-
toms in this study population indicates that
these are not stimulated by combination of
the vaccines."

62,ab‐Freeman (1993).pdf,0.888262916656214,"The existing information on adverse effects of
MMR vaccine in Canada comes from the manufacturer's
list of such effects obtained through premarketing stud-
ies,7 a study of a recently introduced MMR vaccine
(Trivirix)8 and two retrospective family-practice-based
studies.9""0 However, all of these studies have limitations:
the manufacturer's list included occurrences of unspeci-
fied frequency, the Trivirix study relied on a single ex-
amination by a nurse 10 days after vaccination and did
not specify the criteria for an adverse reaction, and the
retrospective studies included only problems sufficiently
serious in the parent's mind to bring the child back to the
doctor's office.
The possible adverse effects listed by the manufac-
turer are malaise, sore throat, headache, fever, rash, ery-
thema, induration, regional lymphadenopathy, parotitis,
orchitis, thrombocytopenia and purpura. Allergic reac-
tions such as urticaria, arthritis, arthralgia and polyneuri-
tis have also been reported. Encephalitis is reported to
occur in one case per million doses of all live vaccines
administered, 1000 times less frequent than the inci-
dence of encephalitis with natural measles infection.7
The Trivirix study found that the principal problems af-
ter vaccination were tonsillitis (in 56.7% of cases), cer-
vical adenopathy (in 43.3%) and parotitis (in 20%).8 The
retrospective studies showed an increase in the number
of physician visits for conjunctivitis, otitis media and up-
per and lower respiratory tract infections.9""0
A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study
of reactions to MMR vaccine in 581 pairs of twins was
conducted in Finland."" The incidence rates of symptoms
such as cough, runny nose, nausea and vomiting,
recorded by the mothers over 1 month after vaccination,
were lower in the vaccinated group than in the placebo
group after the second week; this suggests a ""protective
effect"" of the vaccine, perhaps owing to the induction of
interferon."

tection against varicella was sustained for up to 6 years post-
vaccination, as there was no diminution of VE. It is also notable
that the vast majority of breakthrough varicella cases in the MMRV
and MMR+V groups (87.3% and 76.6%, respectively) were mild (<50
lesions). In the control group varicella cases with <50 lesions
occurred in only 33.8% of the children. The incidence of HZ in the
control group is too low to comment on the impact of vaccination
on this disease although it can be noted that there were no
reported cases in the MMRV group.

64,ab‐Peltola (1986).pdf,0.8873093394072694,"At least two factors may explain the small difference
between the vaccinated and placebo groups and the high
frequency of various ""reactions"" attributed to vaccinations in
general. Firstly, if a child has been immunised, the parents
observe him, intentionally or not, more closely than usual,
and will tend to blame the vaccination for any signs or
symptoms. Secondly, acute infectious diseases are common
in a normal, otherwise healthy child population. An
epidemiological survey conducted among 7000 children
942
under 16 years of age in Helsinki in 197817 showed that at any
time symptoms of common cold were found in 10% of the
children, diarrhoea in 5-9% of the boys and 4-5% of the
girls, and otitis media in 5-9% of the boys and 2-3% of the
girls. Because most of the ""vaccination reactions"" are
symptoms and signs found also in the common infections-a
fever being a classical example-the possibility of concurrent
infection is often ignored.
Respiratory symptoms, nausea, and vomiting were more
common in the controls than in the vaccinees from the second
week onwards, as though the MMR vaccine had had a
protective effect. In the early 1950s the combination of
vaccinia and yellow-fever vaccines was found to reduce the
frequency of yellow-fever seroconversions,18 and the
combination of measles (with or without yellow fever) and
smallpox vaccines showed a similar effect.19 Production of
interferon in these circumstances might explain this
finding.3,2o Thus the MMR 
vaccine might, in fact, give some
transient protection against the common cold.
This study examined common reactions attributable to the
MMR vaccine, but similar results might be obtained with
other vaccines if studied under controlled conditions. Many
vaccines may be safer than is at present recognised.

Three lots of Lirutrin (measles-mumps-rubella
live, attenuated virus vaccine) were evaluated in
a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study
involving 273 children. The vaccine consisted of
a combination of Schwarz strain measles, Jeryl
Lynn strain mumps, and Cendehill strain rubella
vaccine viruses. The frequency of positive clinical
findings was essentially the same in susceptible
vaccinees, immune vaccinees, and placebo recipi-
ents ; indicating that the observed symptoms
were not caused by the vaccine. Antibody assay
of paired serum samples revealed that measles,
mumps, and rubella seroconversion rates in triple
susceptible vaccinees were excellent, ranging
from 96 to 98 per cent with all three lots com-
bined. Results of this study show that Lirutrin
trivalent vaccine is well tolerated and highly
effective.

the child is around the age of 9 months. At this age the
transplacental antibodies in most children have disap-
peared [4]. Children can be vaccinated then in order to
induce protection before the age of risk. Despite early
vaccination at 9 months of age, measles continues to be
a major child health problem in the developing coun-
tries [5]. Many children are now being revaccinated
with measles or MMR vaccines at 15 months of age
after initial vaccination. This two dose schedule is
implemented in 12 of 22 countries in the Eastern Med-
iterranean Region of WHO including Bahrain, Islamic
Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Oman, Qatar, Saudia Arabia, Syrian Arab
Republic, Tunusia, United Arab Emirates [5,6]. The
Turkish Ministry of Health provides the monocompo-
nent live MV to children at 9 months of age free of
charge. Most of the pediatricians also recommend the
administration of MMR (not covered under the gov-
ernment insurance policies) at 15 months of age, after
this ﬁrst dose of MV.
The effectiveness of early vaccination and revaccina-
tion against measles is not clearly established in devel-
oping countries. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the immunogenicity and protection rate of
revaccination with MMR vaccine at 15 months of age
after initial vaccination at 9 months of age in compari-
son with children who received single dose of MMR
vaccine at 12 months of age.

the effect of MMR vaccination is mainly due to the measles
component, and not to all 3 components of MMR vaccine.
The association was particularly strong for lower respiratory
tract infections (HR of 0.18; 95% CI: 0:07 to 00:48) and resulted
highly protective against hospitalizations for all infectious dis-
eases (HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0:25 to 00:34).
Vaccination remains one of the safest and effective interven-
tions available in public health for the primary prevention of
infectious diseases, resulting in a medical practice that induces
both direct and indirect immunity in individuals vaccinated
(herd immunity).12,20
The immunological mechanism underlying this effect is not
yet entirely understood, but may involve genetic modulation
systems; many studies are being performed to investigate the
protective effects of non-speciﬁc vaccines in low-income coun-
tries with a high prevalence of infectious diseases.12,20
The mechanisms of immunization induced by the MMR
vaccine and the long persistence of B-cell antigen-speciﬁc
memory (MBCS) in children and young adults still remain
unclear.21-22
Genetic polymorphisms may be signiﬁcantly associated with
the variability of response mechanisms to infection and vacci-
nation. In particular, the genetic polymorphisms of various
families of genes with known immune function, including HLA
genes, cytokine and the cytokine receptors, genes that control
the innate and humoral immunity, are signiﬁcantly associated
with changes in the immune response to therubella vaccine.23
On the contrary, the determinants of immunity induced by
the mumps vaccine have not yet been completely clariﬁed.24
The variability of the immune response modulated by the
human leukocyte antigen gene (HLA) and by genes for cyto-
kines, appears to be an important factor in the protection

vaccination is also likely to be better than one dose in 
further reducing the risk of VZV transmission.22
We identified no evidence that the protection afforded 
by one or two doses of live varicella vaccine was 
diminished over 3 years in the face of highly endemic 
disease. The relatively greater protection against even 
mild varicella afforded by the short two-dose (MMRV) 
schedule compared with the one-dose (monovalent 
varicella vaccine) schedule was associated with an 
increased anti-VZV GMC and seropositivity rate at all 
timepoints after full vaccination, in line with earlier 
studies.8,11,25–29 VZV exposure (including subclinical in­
fections) after day 84 might have boosted the anti-VZV 
antibody responses at later timepoints, but this effect, if 
substantial, should have narrowed the difference between 
MMRV and MMR+V groups and that was not noted.
Reactogenicity and safety variables were in line with 
other studies,8,11,25–27,29–33 including the findings that in 
MMRV recipients com­pared with MMR recipients, fever 
within 15 days after the first dose was more frequent, 
especially at day 9; and injection-site redness within 4 days 
after the second dose was more frequent.8,11,25,31,33 An 
increased risk of febrile seizure 7–10 days after the first 
dose of MMRV (ProQuad, Merck & Co, Whitehouse 
Station, NJ, USA) has been reported elsewhere in an 
analysis of vaccine surveillance data from 459 000 infants.24 
Although three of the four febrile seizures related to

autism with either MMR or a single measles vaccine.
Key Words: MMR vaccine, autism, children
(Pediatr Infect Dis J 2010;29: 397–400)
A
great deal of speculation exists concerning the possible
associations of certain vaccines, particularly the measles-
mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, with autism. Wakeﬁeld et al1
were the ﬁrst to propose that the MMR vaccine might be causally
linked to autism. It was suggested that gastrointestinal and devel-
opmental symptoms constituted a syndrome that might be trig-
gered by this vaccine. Their study was widely criticized but
generated immense media attention, leading to a fall in MMR
coverage in some European countries.2–5 Since that report, a
number of other studies have found no evidence to support a link
between MMR vaccination and autism.6–9
Although Poland continues to report high MMR vaccination
coverage, questions concerning the safety of this vaccine, boosted
by periodic antivaccination campaigns, persist. The MMR vaccine
was introduced in Poland later than in most other European
countries. For the past 10 years, the MMR vaccine has been
gradually replacing the single-antigen measles variety. When it
was ﬁrst introduced, MMR was not covered by the national health
service of Poland. Parents who wished to vaccinate their children
with MMR, as opposed to the single mandatory measles vaccine,
had to pay extra. For this reason, few children were immunized
with MMR. The Polish mandatory vaccinations schedule did not
include MMR for all children until 2004. Since then, already high
levels of immunization against measles have slightly grown.10
Poland’s heterogeneous population (ie, vaccinated with MMR,
vaccinated against measles only, nonvaccinated) serves as a
unique sample group for studying the debated association of
these vaccines with autism in children. Although a wide variety
of published studies fail to ﬁnd any such inﬂuence or relation-
ship, the association between MMR and autism remains in the
minds of some medical workers and parents."
73,ab‐Peltola (1986).pdf,0.8854008328051333,"Discussion
The results of the present study show that adverse reactions
to the widely used MMR 
vaccine are much less common than
was previously thought. A temporal association between
vaccination and symptoms appearing in the following days or
weeks does not necessarily imply a causal relationship, 3,15,16
and the results of the preserit investigation further emphasise
the importance of studying a control group for comparison in
estimating the frequencies of adverse reactions caused by
vaccines. Little attention has been paid to the true
reactogenicity of the MMR 
vaccine, although in the USA, for
instance, it is given routinely to almost every child. We are
aware of only one study that compared reactions in an MMR
vaccinated group and a placebo group.3 The results are in
accordance with those of our study; respiratory symptoms,
for example, were reported in 72% of vaccinees and 74% of
controls.
The design of a twin study may reduce differences in
behavioural symptoms or signs within pairs. In our study it is
likely that irritability or willingness to stay in bed due to
MMR 
vaccination was reflected in the behaviour of the other
twin too, especially in the youngest age groups. On the other
hand, there are no grounds to suspect that reporting of clearly
measurable events, such as fever, or skin, eye, or joint signs,
or respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, would have been
biased.
The study was designed to explore relatively common
symptoms and signs occurring after the vaccination. The
confidence intervals show that our sample size has the power
to detect adverse reactions attributable to the MMR 
vaccine
down to a frequency of 1-3%, depending on the background
frequency of that particular symptom or sign. The upper
limits of the intervals also show that no symptom or sign
affected more than 6% of vaccinees (table i).
Rare reactions due to the MMR 
vaccine cannot be studied
with this small sample. We are, however, collecting data on
500 000 vaccinees, which should reveal all essential compli-
cations caused by this live vaccine.
At least two factors may explain the small difference
between the vaccinated and placebo groups and the high
frequency of various ""reactions"" attributed to vaccinations in
general."
74,ca‐La Torre (2017).pdf,0.8849443947424754,"According to the national calendar of vacci-
nations which are actively offered to the entire population, the
anti MMR vaccine is given in 2 doses: at 13th -15th month,
5–6 y (and eventually at 11–18 years)18
A recent research, conducted in a cohort of Danish children,
revealed that administration of live MMR vaccine versus inacti-
vated DTaP-IPV-Hib, is associated with a lower rate of hospital
admissions for generic type infections.19
This retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the impact
of MMR vaccination on hospitalization for infectious events
and respiratory pathologies (including asthma), and focuses on
the pediatric population in the areas of competence of the local
health unit ASL Rome1, for a follow up of 2 y. Therefore, it
intends to evaluate the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine in
reducing hospitalizations from any target infectious disease,
and from respiratory diseases and refers to children born in the
period ranged between 2008 -2010, who subsequently under-
went vaccination in 2009–2011 and resident in the territories of
the ASL Rome1.
Results
The study involved the analysis of 11,004 children (5535 males,
5469 females) of mainly Italian nationality (89.1%), resident in
the territory of ASL Rome 1.
2302 of these children (20.9%) did not receive the MMR
vaccination, 5392 (49%) received one dose and 3310 (30.1%)
received 2 doses of this vaccine.
With regard to the target diseases of vaccination, over the
period studied, no hospitalizations occurred for Rubella, 2 hos-
pitalizations were seen for Mumps (1 among vaccinated and 1
among unvaccinated children) and 12 occurred for Measles, of
which 9 (0.4%) among not vaccinated group, 3 (0.1%) among
those vaccinated with one dose, and none among those who
received 2 doses of vaccine (p < 0.001) (Table 1)."

used several sources for obtaining the cases. In February to
December 2004, we searched the administrative diagnosis
registries at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and the
National Patient Register of the National Board of Health
and Welfare. Two of the authors (C.A., O.A.) reviewed all
records with the diagnoses multiple sclerosis, demyelinat-
ing disorders in the central nervous system, acute transverse
myelitis, optic neuritis and retrobulbar neuritis, according to
the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) 10, 9, and
8. We reclassiﬁed all cases according to both the Poser
criteria [28] with an added category of ‘‘clinically isolated
syndromes’’ (CIS) [29] and the McDonald criteria [30]."
76,ab‐Freeman (1993).pdf,0.8841438429480939,"Because of the involvement of twins in that
trial, subtraction of the incidence of a given symptom in
the twin receiving the placebo from the incidence of the
same symptom in the vaccinated twin revealed a true ad-
verse reaction rate for each of 15 signs and symptoms.
These rates were much lower than generally reported.
The authors attributed this to the frequent occurrence of
symptoms in children in general and suggested that
MMR vaccine is safer than currently recognized. The
study had the weakness of relying only on the observa-
tions of the mothers; the investigators were unable to
comment on the incidence of otitis media, tonsillitis and
lymphadenopathy, which require the examination by an
objective, medically trained observer.
Our second goal, to compare postvaccine illnesses
in children vaccinated at different ages, will add to the
debate about the optimum time to vaccinate children.
The manufacturer and the National Advisory Committee
on Immunization recommend vaccination after 12
months to avoid interference with the immunogenic re-
sponse by maternal antibodies.7""2 However, other author-
ities have asked that the vaccine not be given until 15
months, because 12-month-old recipients had a lower
seroconversion rate than 15-month-old recipients.2 The
attack rate in measles outbreaks in the United States and
Canada has been two to three times higher in children
vaccinated at 12 to 13 months of age than in those vacci-
nated at 15 months.'3
Methods
The study was conducted by 22 family physicians
in Oxford and Middlesex counties and the Waterloo re-
gion of southwestern Ontario. The design was a prospec-
tive cluster randomized controlled study in which half of
the family physicians were randomly assigned to admin-
ister the MMR vaccine (M-M-R II; Merck Sharp &
Dohme Canada, Kirkland, Que.) at 13 months and the

other half at 15 months. Thirteen months was chosen in-
stead of 12 months to ensure that vaccination occurred
after the twelfth month, to comply with current recom-
mendations. All babies were identified in each practice
who were due to receive MMR vaccine in the next year."

2.1. Study design and participants
The study design was previously described [14]. Brieﬂy, this
study is a follow-up of the phase A, observer-blind, controlled,
study conducted in Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Nor-
way, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia and Sweden
between 2009 and 2015, in accordance with the Declaration of Hel-
sinki and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical
Practice guidelines [15,16]. The study protocol was reviewed and
approved by independent ethics committees. Protocol deviations
were presented elsewhere [14].
In phase A of the study, healthy children aged 12–22 months
from
the
ten
countries
mentioned
above
were
randomized
(3:3:1) to one of the three treatment groups, and received either
two doses of MMRV (Priorix-Tetra, GSK) at Day 0 and Day 42
(MMRV group), or one dose of MMR (Priorix, GSK) at Day 0 and
one dose of monovalent varicella vaccine (Varilrix, GSK) at Day
42 (MMR+V group), or two doses of the MMR (Priorix, GSK) vaccine
(control) at Day 0 and Day 42 (MMR group).
Study population (with inclusion and exclusion criteria), ran-
domization and blinding, as well as vaccine composition and
administration route, were previously described [14].
For phase B, the study remained observer-blind for all groups
with the exception of the MMR+V group in countries where the
national vaccination schedules included a second dose of MMR
vaccination at 4–8 years of age (Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Russian
Federation, Sweden). Independent Data Monitoring Committee
(IDMC) members also remained blinded to the study treatment
group when assessing varicella cases.

ABSTRACT
Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in reducing
hospitalizations for infectious disease, targeted and not targeted, as well as from respiratory diseases in
children in Rome.
Methods: The cohort was recomposed through record linkage of 2 archives (vaccination register and
hospital discharge records.
Results: The analysis included 11,004 children. 20.9% did not receive the MMR vaccination, 49% and 30.1%
received one and 2 doses. There were no hospitalizations for rubella, 2 for mumps, and 12 for measles. The
vaccine was highly protective against measles and mumps hospitalizations (HR D 0.10; 95% CI: 0.03.0.34).
Regarding all infectious diseases there were 414 hospitalizations, and the vaccine was protective (HR D
0.29; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.34). Concerning respiratory diseases, there were 809 admissions (7.4%), and the
vaccine was highly protective (HR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.48).
Conclusions: MMR vaccination is effective for the primary prevention of target and not targeted infectious
diseases and may also limit hospitalizations for respiratory diseases."

erate or severe varicella was 95.0% (95% CI: 93.6–96.2) and 99.0%

vaccine (MMR+V) against all and against moderate or severe vari-
cella was 67.0% (95% CI: 61.8–71.4) and 90.3% (95% CI: 86.9–92.8),
respectively. After a median follow-up of 3.3 years, similar efﬁcacy

pared to six cases in the MMR control group (receiving no varicella

87.1% [95% CI: 83.5–90.2], respectively); more than half of the
cases in the MMR control group were moderately severe or severe

Among the children who developed a breakthrough case of vari-
cella in the MMRV and MMR+V groups during the follow-up per-
iod, the majority (87.3% [95% CI: 77.3–94.0] and 76.6% [95% CI:

the number of notiﬁed cases of measles rapidly fell to a level of

In October 1988, a comprehensive campaign of vaccination with
combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was initi-
ated, and in 1989 about 900,000 children age 12–35 months were
vaccinated in the UK [2]. This campaign also provided MMR for
over 800,000 children age 3–9 years [2]. Despite the early program
of single measles vaccine, as well as the 1988 nationwide immu-
nization with MMR, a modest outbreak of measles occurred in 1994
[1,3,4]. This led to a supplemental program of immunization with a
vaccine against measles-rubella (MR) [1,3,4], as well as MMR, even
though at that time the MMR vaccine was reported to be in short
supply [1,3].
In this paper we describe, in detail, the incidence of measles in
the UK and the effectiveness of the measles vaccines given prior to
and after the 1994 measles outbreak.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data source
The study was based on information derived from the General
Practice Research Database (the Database), a large automated UK
medical record database. The source population for the study is
some 3 million people enrolled in about 350 general practices since
1988. The size of the population is stable over time according to
age, gender and general practice. The comprehensive nature of the
information on clinical diagnoses and drug exposure recorded in
this subset of the Database have been repeatedly validated and
found to be of high quality for the purpose of conducting epi-
demiologic research [2,5–8]. The general practitioners (GPs), who
contribute data to the Database use ofﬁce computers in their rou-
tine practice, agreed to provide the data for research purposes,
and have been trained to record medical information including
demographic data, medical diagnoses, details of hospital stays, and
deaths, in a standard, anonymous format. The GPs routinely record
the administration of vaccines."

with MMR had a risk equal to half of those vaccinated with the
single measles variety. The only signiﬁcant association for being
vaccinated before the onset of symptoms was found for the
difference between MMR vaccination and nonvaccination.
Odds ratios did not change substantially after adjusting for
potential confounders (eg, mother’s age, medication during preg-
nancy, gestation time, perinatal injury, and 5-minute Apgar scale
scores) (Table 4). Vaccination before diagnosis, regardless of
vaccine variety used, signiﬁcantly decreased the probability of
being diagnosed with autism. Children vaccinated with MMR had
a lower odds ratio of having autism than nonvaccinated children as
well as those vaccinated with the single measles vaccine. After
adjusting for potential confounders, the association between being
vaccinated before the onset of symptoms and type of vaccine used
became signiﬁcant. The risk of having autism in children vacci-
nated with MMR was only 44% comparing to children vaccinated
only against measles.
All models ﬁt the data (likelihood ratio 2, P values mostly
0.0001, the larger one equals 0.0013).
DISCUSSION
Our study revealed that MMR vaccination was not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with an increased risk of autism in children. In a
separate analysis, a similar result was achieved for the single-
antigen measles vaccine. An unexpected ﬁnding was that odds
ratios associated with MMR were lower than with the single
measles vaccine.
Our results argue against the Wakeﬁeld et al hypothesis,1
which suggested that developmental symptoms in children with
autism may be triggered by the presence of the measles virus in the
bowels of children vaccinated with MMR. He stated that the
simultaneous administration of 3 types of live viruses in the MMR
vaccine was too great a burden for a child’s immunologic system,
increasing the chance of measles virus persistence, subsequently
leading to the development of autistic symptoms. Therefore in
many countries, the increased incidence of childhood autism was
initially linked with the launching of MMR vaccination cam-
paigns."

90,ab‐Ceyhan (2001).pdf,0.8814815771287644,"Subjects in Group B received
MMR at 12 months of age. Blood samples were col-
lected just before and 6 weeks after the vaccination.
After each vaccination, all vaccine recipients were vis-
ited by midwives in child health care at their homes on
7, 14, and 28th postvaccination days to collect adverse
reaction records that the parents were asked to make
notes. Adverse reactions were deﬁned as a temperature
of 39.4 °C (103 °F), cough, runny nose, diarrhea, any
rash after vaccination, local reactions as redness and
swelling and also change in the alertness and overall
activity of the child, seizures, hypersensitivity reactions.
Subjects were followed with phone calls and/or home
visits every 3 months for 60 months after vaccination.
A standard questionnaire including the possible adverse
reactions was used during these phone calls. Parents
were asked to report occurrence of measles in the
vaccines and a measles case was deﬁned as a subject
diagnosed by a physician with pathognomonic enan-
them (Koplik’s spots), cough, coryza and conjunctivitis
and maculopapular rash. In patients with no pathog-
nomonic sign measles serologies were obtained. The
severe cases were described as patients with acute en-
cephalitis, bronchopneumonia, and respiratory distress.
2.4. Serological tests
Total speciﬁc levels of measles, mumps, and rubella
Ig Gs were determined by commercial ELISA (Trinity
Biotech Plc, Jamestown, USA). The test sera, positive
and negative control sera, and calibrator were diluted
1:21 in serum diluent, 100 l of them were added to the
wells with additional 100 l serum diluent to reagent
blank well. Each well was incubated at room tempera-
ture for 20 min and aspirated, washed with wash buffer
four times. Then, 100 l conjugate was added to the
wells followed by 20 min incubation at room tempera-
ture and washing ﬁve times with wash buffer."
91,ba‐Castilla-2 (2009).pdf,0.8814791499411477,"Among the controls, 98.1% were vaccinated, and 95.7% of those
older than 6 years had received two doses of MMR vaccine.
The unmatched comparison of cases and controls showed a
higher percentage of non-vaccinated persons in the ﬁrst group
(5.4% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.005). The median age in vaccinated cases was
15 months (range 11–72) at the ﬁrst dose and 77 months (range
37–88) at the second dose. Vaccinated cases and controls did not
differ in the age at which they received each dose.
3.2. Effectiveness of the vaccine
Table 2 shows the results of the conditional logistic regression
analysis. The effectiveness of having received any dose of MMR vac-
cine was 72% (95% CI, 39–87%). The effectiveness of two doses of
vaccine reached 83% (95% CI, 54–94%), and that of one dose was
66% (95% CI, 25–85%).
The analysis limited only to those children who had received
any dose of MMR vaccine showed that the second dose provided a
non-statistically signiﬁcant additional protection of 49% compared
to those who had only one dose. Administration of the ﬁrst dose
before 14 months or after 36 months of age was associated with a
higher risk of mumps compared to those who had been vaccinated
within this age interval, although the risk reached statistical signif-
icance only in the latter age group (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 0.91–4.29 and
OR = 3.11; 95% CI 1.15–8.43, respectively) (Table 3). In 57% of cases
and 56% of controls who received the ﬁrst dose after 36 months
of age the MMR vaccine had been co-administered with other vac-
cines.
The analysis limited only to children vaccinated with two doses
showed that the risk of mumps was higher with increasing time
since the last dose of MMR vaccine (Table 4)."
92,aa-Henry (2018).pdf,0.8812334531985316,"2). The percentage of seronegative children in the control
group decreased from 97.8% (95% CI: 95.0–99.3) (at Day 42) to
44.9% (95% CI: 37.4–52.6) (at Year 6). By country (except Greece,
where centers were closed prior to the start of Phase B due to
implementation of varicella vaccination program), at year 6, the
proportion of seronegative children varied from 0% (95% CI: 0–
28.5) in Romania to 80% (95% CI: 28.4–99.5) in Sweden.
3.4. Safety
From the start of phase B to Year 6, a total of 570 SAEs were
reported for 422 children; none of the SAEs were fatal or consid-
ered vaccine-related by the investigator.
Four children reported SAEs (leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma,
lymphadenopathy, and thrombocytopenia) that resulted in with-
drawal from the study.
4. Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst study to assess the
VE of one- or two-dose varicella vaccination, in the presence
of a control group, over a period of approximately 6 years.
Data on longer term protection (10 years) is currently being
collected.
After a follow-up of 6 years (median: 6.4 years), the efﬁcacy of
two doses of MMRV against all varicella and against moderate to
severe varicella was >95%. This protection was greater than that
provided by one dose of MMR+V, which had an efﬁcacy against
all varicella of 67.0%, and against moderate to severe varicella of
>90.0%. Compared to Year 3 data [14] it can be observed that pro-
tection against varicella was sustained for up to 6 years post-
vaccination, as there was no diminution of VE."

18 times higher (1839 vs 97 mIU/mL) and the sero­
response rate was higher (99·6% vs 79·2%) than 42 days 
after dose one (see figure 4B). Although reduced at 
2 years, the apparent improved immunogenicity of two 
live varicella-vaccine doses compared with one dose 
persisted, such that the occurrence of seroresponse for 
two doses versus one dose was 96·1% (95% CI 95·1–96·9) 
versus 78·2% (76·2–80·0) and the anti-VZV antibody 
GMCs were 414 mIU/mL (95% CI 392–438) versus 
169 mIU/mL (157–182). After 2 years, the percentage of 
seropositive participants in the control group (who were 
seronegative before vaccination) was 26·6% (95% CI 
23·2–30·2).
Redness was the most frequently reported solicited 
injection-site symptom in each group and after each dose 
(table 3). After dose two, 24·8% of participants who 
received MMRV reported redness by contrast with 13·7% 
of those who received monovalent varicella vac­cine and 
9·3% of those who received MMR."

The study was based in two areas of Nottingham (Rushcliffe and Broxtowe) and was

measles vaccination at this time (age 13-15 months) were obtained from health visitors' 
birth books. Parents were approached by letter. If they expressed an interest in the study 
they were visited by a doctor (SE), the study was explained in detail and written consent 
was obtained.

95,bb‐Mrozek‐Budzyn (2010).pdf,0.8807854375981043,"Introducing the MMR vaccine as a replacement for the
single-antigen measles vaccine in the mandatory vaccination
schedule improved vaccination coverage against measles in Po-
land. This serves as evidence that, despite extensive media cover-
age of the debated association between MMR and autism, public
acceptance of this vaccine remains very high. The situation in
Poland is different to that of many European countries, where
MMR vaccinations by age 2 years fell more than 10% and were
followed by measles outbreaks. In this time, Poland’s already high
rate of measles immunization even slightly increased.10
We were able to control many potential confounding fac-
tors, known to be associated with vaccination practices and pos-
sibly serving as risk factors for autism. We included 2 index dates
to assess previous vaccination: the onset of symptoms and of
diagnosis of autism. Parental concern in regards to symptoms and
symptom etiology, reported retrospectively, can be biased by
confounding factors. Date of diagnosis based on physician’s
records is not affected by recall bias, serving as a better index date
than the onset of symptoms.
One limitation of this study included omitting other perva-
sive developmental disorders. The decision was made to restrict
the study population to cases of autism in the interest of better

sumably account for the reported increased use of pre-
scription drugs. This is perhaps understandable, since the
symptoms and signs that were found are not mentioned
in the product literature as being vaccine related. As the
evidence about the common illness patterns after routine
MMR vaccination accumulates, it may be important to
include this information in the product literature so that
unnecessary treatment is avoided and parents are pro-
vided with more accurate information about what to ex-
pect in their children.
In conclusion, family physicians should tell parents
of children receiving MMR vaccine to watch for fever,
cough and runny nose in the first week after vaccination
and rash in the second and third week.
Our study was successful in showing that commu-
nity-based surveillance of adverse reactions to a vac-
cine can be carried out in family physicians' offices. It
can serve as a prototype for further studies of reac-
tions, especially given the increased interest in vac-
cines and their possible side effects as well as the
proliferation of new vaccines expected to be intro-
duced in the near future.

98,bb‐Ahlgren (2009).pdf,0.8806492805745253,"However, our unexpected ﬁnding that early
MMR vaccination was associated with higher risk of MS
than late MMR vaccination may be the result of chance and
should be treated with caution. The group of study partici-
pants who had received early vaccinations only was small
(N = 61), less than 10% of the vaccinated individuals with
available child health and school health records. Eight MS
patients and 26 controls were MMR vaccinated at a young
age only. Although signiﬁcant in the present Gothenburg
material, the association with ‘early MMR vaccination
only’ was an isolated ﬁnding, which was based on a small
number of subjects and only provides relatively weak evi-
dence. There have been no studies published which con-
sidered age at measles, mumps, rubella vaccination and the
subsequent risk of MS. Thus, the possible importance of age
at vaccination needs to be conﬁrmed or refuted in other
study material. We conﬁrmed the result obtained by a pre-
vious large population-based case–control study showing
that ever having been vaccinated against measles, mumps or
rubella does not increase the risk of MS [38].
In summary, infectious mononucleosis increased the risk
of subsequent MS, while there was no indication that
infection with measles, mumps, rubella or varicella, alone
or as a group, explains the development of MS. Any effect
on the risk of developing MS from these infections must be
small. Furthermore, there was no indication that infectious
mononucleosis augments the signiﬁcance of other infec-
tions. The possible beneﬁt of including a vaccine against
EBV in the vaccination programme should be investigated.
Conclusions
The strength of this study is that it exploited the large
differences between the numbers of exposed and unex-
posed individuals that occurred during the mass vaccina-
tion campaigns against measles, mumps and rubella.
Furthermore, we used information from two sources,
questionnaire data and data from the more objective child
health and school health records, and these two sources
gave very similar results."
