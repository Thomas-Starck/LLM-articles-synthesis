We aim to determine the effects of HRT in post-menopausal women with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.



LLM-Generated Answer based on selected excerpts and context:

Based on the excerpts provided, the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in post-menopausal women appear to be complex and somewhat contradictory.

1. **Secondary Prevention in Women with Established Cardiovascular Disease**: The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) found no overall reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events among postmenopausal women with established coronary disease who received estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to placebo. Specifically, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death during an average follow-up of 4.1 years (Excerpt 25, Excerpt 54). Additionally, the study indicated an early increased risk of CHD events in the first year of treatment, which was not sustained in subsequent years (Excerpt 94).

2. **Primary Prevention in Healthy Women**: There is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effects of HRT on primary prevention in healthy postmenopausal women without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement therapy may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but these findings have not been consistently replicated in clinical trials (Excerpt 37, Excerpt 90). The Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT) indicated that unopposed estrogen may slow the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy postmenopausal women, but this has not been tested in women with established cardiovascular disease (Excerpt 90).

3. **Potential Risks**: The HERS trial also highlighted potential risks associated with HRT, including an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and gallbladder disease in the hormone group compared to placebo (Excerpt 54, Excerpt 71). Furthermore, the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events during the first years of follow-up among women treated with either estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin (Excerpt 93).

4. **Quality of Life and Other Benefits**: While HRT has been associated with improvements in quality of life, such as relief from vasomotor symptoms and enhanced well-being, its cardiovascular benefits remain uncertain (Excerpt 35, Excerpt 40).

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that HRT does not provide cardiovascular benefits for secondary prevention in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease and may even pose risks. The effects of HRT for primary prevention in healthy postmenopausal women are less clear and require further investigation.

Original author's systematic review summary':

At present, a recommendation for initiating HRT for the reason of preventing cardiovascular events in post‐menopausal women (with or without cardiovascular disease) should not be made. Women with other risk factors for venous thromboembolic events should be discouraged from using HRT if the sole goal is to prevent cardiovascular events.
