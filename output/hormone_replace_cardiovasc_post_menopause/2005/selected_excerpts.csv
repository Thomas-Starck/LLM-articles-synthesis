1. Introduction
One of the earliest positive reports of the effects
of estrogen on the cardiovascular system was a
study
in
estrogen
depleted
female
oophorec-
tomized cynomolgous monkeys. They were all on
cholesterol-rich diet and those given estrogen re-
placement therapy developed much less coronary
artheromathosis compared with the others [1].
After that, several reports from large observa-
tional and epidemiological studies show that hor-
monal replacement therapy (HRT) to healthy
postmenopausal women has beneﬁcial effects on
morbidity and mortality in coronary artery dis-
ease
[2,3].
However,
data
from
randomized
prospective placebo controlled studies are still
missing. Recent retrospective data has pointed out
a slightly increased risk of venous thromboem-
bolism in women using HRT [4–6]. Furthermore,
it is well known that HRT has a positive effect on
quality of life, such as well-being, vasomotor
symptoms, sleeping disturbances and cognitive
functions in climacteric women [7,8]."

Introduction
Data 
from 
observational 
studies 
suggest 
that 
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces the risk of
coronary heart disease. Results of a meta-analysis1
indicate a relative risk of 0·70 for ever users of oestrogen
as HRT, with a slightly lower risk (0·66) for users of
combined therapy (oestrogen plus progestagen). Such
risk reductions seem plausible, since studies show
potentially advantageous changes in lipid profiles,2,3
vessel 
walls,4
fibrinogen 
and 
antithrombin 
III
concentrations,5,6 and insulin secretion7 in women on
HRT. However, possibly unfavourable effects, such as
altered triglyceride8 and factor VII concentrations,9 have
also been reported. Studies that used angiography or
carotid ultrasonography have provided contradictory
evidence. Increased survival in ever users of oestrogen
with greater than 70% coronary artery stenosis was noted
in 
one 
observational 
study.10
Findings 
of 
three
randomised trials,11–14 however, showed no beneficial
effect on progression of coronary arteriosclerosis,
although those of another trial15 indicated a slower rate of
progression 
in 
healthy 
postmenopausal 
women 
who took unopposed oestrogen (17 oestradiol) rather
than placebo. Results of a small trial16 indicate no effect
of conjugated oestrogen on recurrence of ischaemic
events."

In 1998, the findings of the first placebo-controlled,
randomized clinical trial of hormone-replacement
therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiac disease
in postmenopausal women, the Heart and Estrogen/
Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), were reported.
Surprisingly, daily therapy with conjugated estrogen
A
 
and progestin did not reduce the incidence of coro-
nary events or death from any cause during four years
of follow-up.
 
10
 
When that study began, epidemiologic research
also suggested that estrogen might protect against
stroke,
 
11-14
 
 although this evidence was less consistent
than that for protection against coronary heart disease.
Some studies reported no effect of estrogen use on
the risk of stroke,
 
15-22
 
 and two large cohort studies re-
ported an increased risk.
 
23,24
 
 Our study, the Women’s
Estrogen for Stroke Trial, was designed in 1993 as a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of estrogen re-
placement for the secondary prevention of cerebrovas-
cular disease. The primary end point was death from
any cause or nonfatal stroke; secondary outcomes were
transient ischemic attack and nonfatal myocardial in-
farction. Other prespecified analyses included the ef-
fect of estrogen on the rate of death alone, the inci-
dence of stroke alone, the severity of recurrent strokes,
and the incidence of cardiac events.
 
METHODS
 
Study Participants
 
A description of the design and methods of our study has been
reported previously.
 
25
 
 We enrolled postmenopausal women older
than 44 years of age within 90 days after a qualifying ischemic
stroke or transient ischemic attack. Women were recruited between
December 1993 and May 1998. Women were excluded if their in-
dex event was disabling (had a severity score greater than 5 on the
scale used in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarter-
ectomy Trial
 
26
 
) or if it occurred while the woman was taking es-
trogen. Women were considered postmenopausal if they had had
amenorrhea for at least 12 months or if they had undergone hys-
terectomy and were older than 55 years of age."
8,EPAT.pdf,0.8952644828258453,"In those studies, the
cardiovascular effects of HRT may have been masked by
or added no beneﬁt over the effects of the other event-
reducing therapies. Comparison of EPAT participants
who received lipid-lowering medication and ERT with
participants who received ERT but no lipid-lowering
medication conﬁrms this idea. Subanalyses of other
nonrandomized treatment regimens have not yet been
reported in HERS or ERA.
Although observational data indicate that HRT is
associated with a lower incidence of coronary heart dis-
ease in postmenopausal women, most of these data are
associations with unopposed ERT in women without
symptomatic coronary heart disease (5, 6). The observa-
tional arterial imaging studies that support an HRT-
related reduction of atherosclerosis have studied unop-
posed ERT (26–32).
Unopposed ERT inhibited development of athero-
sclerosis in several animal models (45–48). It is conceiv-
able that HRT in general, and unopposed ERT speciﬁ-
cally, may be most effective as primary prevention, when
atherosclerosis is in its early stages, rather than as sec-
ondary prevention, when atherosclerosis is in a later,
established phase. In other words, ERT may be effective
in the prevention rather than the treatment of athero-
sclerosis. This notion is consistent with the possible
proinﬂammatory effects of estrogen. Estrogen increases
levels of C-reactive protein (49–52), a marker of under-
lying inﬂammation that is associated with cardiovascular
events in women (53). Estrogen may reduce early pre-
intrusive atherosclerosis in healthy women but not car-
diovascular events if it promotes arterial thrombosis or
atherosclerotic plaque destabilization in women with es-
tablished cardiovascular disease. This scenario appears
to be consistent with the early events reported in
HERS (40).
It is unclear whether sequential therapy with
medroxyprogesterone acetate or other progestational
agents would result in a different clinical outcome than
that seen with continuous combined therapy in HERS
and ERA."

KEY WORDS: Coronary heart disease, postmenopausal hormone therapy
INTRODUCTION
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of mortality in
women over 50 years of age in the United States [1]. A 50-year-old woman
today has about a 46% lifetime probability of developing CHD and a 31%
chance of dying from it [2]. Many observational studies have found that oral
postmenopausal estrogen therapy is associated with a 35–50% reduction in risk
of CHD [2–4]. The apparent protective effect of estrogen therapy may be even
stronger in women who already have CHD [5].
The reported association between postmenopausal estrogen therapy and
reduced CHD risk, though consistent, biologically plausible, and strong, could
be confounded if women taking estrogen have a more favorable cardiovascular
risk proﬁle than nonusers [6, 7]. Only a comparison of hormone use and placebo
in women who are randomly assigned to therapy can provide deﬁnitive evi-
dence that treatment reduces the risk of CHD. We are therefore conducting
the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a randomized,
double-blind trial of the effect of estrogen plus progestin therapy on the fre-
quency of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction among postmeno-
pausal women with known CHD.
METHODS
Participants
Participants in the HERS are 2763 postmenopausal women <79 years old
who have a uterus and who have CHD evidenced by prior myocardial in-
farction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, mechanical revascularization,
or angiographic evidence of at least a 50% occlusion of one or more major
coronary arteries.
Women were excluded if their reported CHD event had occurred within 6
months of randomization, if they had used postmenopausal hormone therapy
within 3 months of the initial screening, if hormone therapy was thought to
be contraindicated, if they were participating in another trial, or if they were
thought to be unlikely to adhere to the protocol (Table 1).
Women of any race were included."

Summary
Background Results of observational studies suggest that
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could reduce the risk
of coronary heart disease (CHD), but those of randomised
trials do not indicate a lower risk in women who use
oestrogen plus progestagen. The aim of this study was to
ascertain whether or not unopposed oestrogen reduces the
risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women
who survive a first myocardial infarction.
Methods The study was a randomised, blinded, placebo
controlled, secondary prevention trial of postmenopausal
women, age 50–69 years (n=1017) who had survived a first
myocardial infarction. Individuals were recruited from 35
hospitals in England and Wales. Women received either one
tablet of oestradiol valerate (2 mg; n=513) or placebo
(n=504), daily for 2 years. Primary outcomes were
reinfarction or cardiac death, and all-cause mortality.
Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes
were uterine bleeding, endometrial cancer, stroke or other
embolic events, and fractures.
Findings Frequency of reinfarction or cardiac death did not
differ between treatment groups at 24 months (rate ratio
0·99, 95% CI 0·70–1·41, p=0·97). Similarly, the reduction
in all-cause mortality between those who took oestrogen
and those on placebo was not significant (0·79, 0·50–1·27,
p=0·34). The relative risk of any death (0·56, 0·23–1·33)
and cardiac death (0·33, 0·11–1·01) was lowest at 
3 months post-recruitment. 
Interpretation Oestradiol valerate does not reduce the
overall risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal
women who have survived a myocardial infarction.

derlying atherosclerosis mediated by the
observed favorable changes in low- and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.2
The apparent pattern of early in-
crease and later decrease in CHD events
led to the recommendation that women
with CHD should not start treatment
with hormones for the purpose of pre-
venting CHD events, but that those who
were already taking hormones could
continue. Women enrolled in HERS
tended to follow this advice. Many of
those randomized to hormones during
thetrialcontinuedwithopen-labeltreat-
ment prescribed by their personal phy-
sicians and most randomized to pla-
cebo elected not to start hormones. This
provided an opportunity to continue
outcome surveillance for several years
(designated as HERS II) while many
women remained on the regimen to
which they had been randomized.
This article presents cardiovascular
outcomes during a total of 6.8 years of
observation to examine whether longer-
duration postmenopausal hormone
therapy resulted in a reduced risk of
CHD events among women with docu-
mented CHD. A companion article6 ex-
amines the effects of treatment on non-
cardiovascular outcomes.

harmful over the short term."

apart to collect baseline data and to determine ﬁnal
study eligibility. Women were eligible if they were post-
menopausal (serum estradiol level , 73.4 pmol/L [,20
pg/mL]), 45 years of age or older, and had a low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 3.37 mmol/L or
greater ($130 mg/dL)."

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death and dis-
ability in women, accounting for 57% of all deaths, far more than breast or
other cancers [1]. Because of the increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)
in women around menopause, it has been speculated that endogenous estrogen
has an important cardioprotective effect. This speculation has been supported
by observational and case-control studies demonstrating that estrogen replace-
ment therapy in postmenopausal women is associated with lower risk for CHD
[2–7]."

agents would result in a different clinical outcome than
that seen with continuous combined therapy in HERS
and ERA. These and other questions concerning the role
of HRT in the prevention and treatment of atheroscle-
rotic disease in postmenopausal women need further
study. As the initial randomized, controlled trials of ath-
erosclerosis end points in this important area of wom-
en’s health, EPAT, HERS, and ERA indicate new direc-
tions for further investigation.
Conclusions
Overall, we found that healthy postmenopausal
women without preexisting cardiovascular disease who
randomly received unopposed ERT with 17b-estradiol
had less progression of subclinical atherosclerosis than
did those who received placebo. In subgroup analyses,
this result was seen only in women not receiving lipid-
lowering medication. The reduction of the progression
of subclinical atherosclerosis associated with ERT was of
the same magnitude as that in women who received
lipid-lowering medication. Furthermore, lipid-lowering
medication appeared not to add beneﬁt to unopposed
ERT in reducing the progression of subclinical athero-
sclerosis. Although the use of lipid-lowering medication
was not randomized in EPAT, these results are impor-
tant because they suggest that unopposed ERT can serve
as an alternative to lipid-lowering medication as preven-
tive therapy to slow the progression of subclinical ath-
erosclerosis in postmenopausal women who cannot or
do not wish to use lipid-lowering medication.
Since most women who enter menopause are
asymptomatic for cardiovascular disease and 95% of
women who develop cardiovascular disease do so after
menopause, our results suggest that administration of
unopposed 17b-estradiol to women entering menopause
may slow the progression of atherosclerosis and its clin-
ical sequelae (11, 12, 22–25). Two ongoing large clini-
cal trials in predominantly healthy women, the Wom-
en’s Health Initiative (27 000 participants) and the
Women’s International Study of Long Duration Oestro-
gen for Menopause (36 000 participants), will provide
important information on conjugated equine estrogen
for primary prevention of coronary heart disease."

Context.—Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do
not, but this potential beneﬁt has not been conﬁrmed in clinical trials.
Objective.—To determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for
CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease.
Design.—Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial.
Setting.—Outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.
Participants.—A total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80
years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years.
Intervention.—Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of
medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n =1380) or a placebo of identical
appearance (n=1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to
hormonetreatment were taking it at the end of 1 year,and75%attheendof3years.
Main Outcome Measures.—The primary outcome was the occurrence of non-
fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes
included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, re-
suscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arte-
rial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.
Results.—Overall, there were no signiﬁcant differences between groups in the
primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women
in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death
(relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22)."

28,WHI‐2002-2.pdf,0.8876677058641055,"The idea that postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy may reduce
the risk of coronary heart disease has been evolving for some time. Prior
to 1980, some believed that exogenous estrogen would increase the risk of
cardiovascular events based, in part, on the adverse effects of estrogen therapy
in men with heart disease [49] and in those being treated for prostate cancer
[50] and on the emerging evidence that oral contraceptive pills were associated
with an increased risk of stroke, thromboembolic events, and coronary heart
disease among women over 35 [51]. However, the role of menopause as a risk
Design of the Women’s Health Initiative

factor for coronary heart disease was recognized during the 1980s [52–54].
Menopause has an adverse effect on the lipid proﬁle. Low-density lipoprotein
rises for approximately 10 to 15 years after menopause, and high-density lipo-
protein drops [55]. Weight gain and a change in body fat distribution, increases
in blood pressure, and a host of other metabolic factors are among the other
changes that may affect risk.
Epidemiologic evidence for a cardioprotective effect of postmenopausal es-
trogen therapy began to emerge in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A majority
of the more than 30 observational studies reported note a beneﬁt from estrogen
[56, 57]. Supporting this conclusion are studies showing that age-adjusted, all-
cause mortality is also lower among estrogen users [58, 59]. It is important to
note, however, that only one small prospective controlled trial with disease
endpoints has been conducted [60].
The mechanism for the hypothesized improvement in cardiovascular risk
with estrogen is not completely understood, but up to half of the effect may
be explained by the beneﬁcial lipid changes that occur with estrogen administra-
tion [59]. Exogenous estrogen increases HDL and lowers LDL [5, 61, 62]. Other
factors that may play a role are changes in coagulation factors, blood pressure,
insulin, body fat distribution, and direct effects on the arterial wall [5, 63].
Despite the apparent strength of the observational study reports, major
questions remain. First, observational studies are always subject to potential
bias."

COMMENT
This trial fails to demonstrate that ei-
ther HRT or antioxidant vitamin
supplements provide cardiovascular
benefit to postmenopausal women with
coronary disease. In fact, potential harm
was seen for both treatments. The pri-
mary end point of the trial was de-
fined as coronary angiographic change,
with the worst ranks imputed to women
who died or experienced nonfatal MI.
This end point, which was selected be-
fore the trial, has the advantage of in-
corporating both clinical events and an-
giographic change, which is a predictor
of future coronary events, into 1 end
point. By this measure, the increased
risk associated with HRT was statisti-
cally significant (P=.045) and the in-
creased risk associated with antioxi-
dant vitamins was of borderline
statistical significance (P=.09). All-
cause mortality was higher in women
assigned to antioxidant vitamins com-
pared with vitamin placebo (HR, 2.8;
95% CI, 1.1-7.2; P=.047)."

on common noncardiovascular disease outcomes.
Design and Setting Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years’ du-
ration (HERS) and subsequent open-label observational follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS
II), carried out between 1993 and 2000 in outpatient and community settings at 20
US clinical centers.
Participants A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary disease and av-
erage age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those surviving)
consented to follow-up in HERS II.
Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of con-
jugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=1380) or placebo
(n=1383) during HERS; open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal phy-
sicians’ discretion during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hor-
mones declined from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group and in-
creased from 0% (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group.
Main Outcome Measures Thromboembolic events, biliary tract surgery, cancer,
fracture, and total mortality.
Results Comparing women assigned to hormone therapy with those assigned to
placebo, the unadjusted intention-to-treat relative hazard (RH) for venous thrombo-
embolism declined from 2.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-5.04) during HERS
to 1.40 (95% CI, 0.64-3.05) during HERS II (P for time trend=.08); it was 2.08 over-
all for the 6.8 years (95% CI, 1.28-3.40), and 3 of the 73 women with thromboem-
bolism died within 30 days due to pulmonary embolism."

37,ERA-2.pdf,0.8851138879844336,"This speculation has been supported
by observational and case-control studies demonstrating that estrogen replace-
ment therapy in postmenopausal women is associated with lower risk for CHD
[2–7]. In epidemiologic meta-analyses [8–10], long-term use of postmenopausal
estrogen was associated with a 50% lower risk of CVD. The relationship ob-
served between estrogen replacement and CHD risk is even more striking in
older women with coronary artery disease [11, 12].
Despite the observational data suggesting estrogen’s cardioprotective effect,
its actual beneﬁts and risks have not been fully evaluated. In 1998, the Heart
and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) showed no beneﬁt of 4.1
years of estrogen plus progestin therapy for secondary prevention of heart
disease in postmenopausal women [13]. Within the overall null effect, there
was a reduction in risk after 2 years of treatment unexpectedly offset by an
increased risk during the ﬁrst year. It remains unclear whether this pattern of
changing risk over time was simply a chance occurrence combined with no
real effect of the regimen, or due to an early adverse and late beneﬁcial effect
of the regimen.
A major question concerning the HERS trial results is whether the addition
of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Proverat) blocked estro-
gen’s cardioprotective effects. Currently, clinicians administer a progestin with
estrogen to prevent unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial carcinoma in
women with intact uteri. However, MPA and 19-nor testosterone progestins
blunt the favorable changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
associated with estrogen use [14, 15]. Furthermore, in nonhuman primates,
continuous low-dose MPA substantially reduced estrogen’s favorable effect
on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis [16]. On the other hand, the
attenuation of estrogen-induced increases in HDL-C may be offset by the pro-
gestins’ protection against estrogen-induced increases in triglycerides and fac-
tor VII [17, 18]. Observational studies provide no evidence that combined
therapy increases the risk of CHD compared with estrogen alone [19–21]."

Abstract
Objecti6es: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of HRT on symptoms of angina pectoris,
quality of life and factors of importance for compliance in women with ischemic heart disease. Methods: Sixty
postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease were randomized into three groups: one group received
transdermal 17b-estradiol at a dose of 50 mg per 24 h alone for 18 days followed by 10 days of combined treatment
with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 5 mg orally; the second group received placebo and the third group
received conjugated estrogens orally for 18 days followed by a combined treatment with MPA for 10 days. Clinical
evaluations were performed at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigations included gynecological history,
occurrence of climacteric symptoms, quality of life evaluation, cardiac history and symptoms of angina pectoris.
Results: Forty-six women (77%) completed the study during 1 year. The following cardiac events occurred in the
women who completed the study: one patient was hospitalized because of congestive heart failure (patch), two
patients because of angina pectoris, one patient because of coronary bypass operation (CEE) and three patients
underwent balloon dilatation (placebo), all three on CEE. Among the 14 women who discontinued, two patients had
TIA (patch), one experienced palpitations (CEE) and one woman died from myocardial infarction (placebo)."
41,HERS II-2.pdf,0.8837857374016131,"We also took steps to pre-

efforts to avoid between-group bias is
supported by the comparability in the
timingandcompletenesswithwhichthe
telephone contacts were made and clini-

Important limitations of HERS stem
from the older age of HERS partici-
pants, who averaged 67 years at base-
line and 74 years at the end of HERS
II, the presence of coronary disease on
entry, and the particular estrogen and
progestin that we chose to study.
These characteristics limit generaliz-
ability, and the effects of other hor-
mones in younger, healthier post-

CONCLUSIONS
Treatment with estrogen plus proges-
tin in older women with coronary dis-
ease increased the rates of venous
thromboembolism and biliary tract
surgery and did not produce favorable
trends in overall rates of CVD,1 frac-
ture, or death. Postmenopausal hor-
mone therapy should be limited to
indications that are supported by
randomized trial evidence that benefi-
cial clinical outcomes outweigh harm-
ful ones."

WHI Study Group
The potential adverse effect that generates the most concern is the possibility
of an increased risk of breast cancer with long-term estrogen use. The numerous
observational studies have yielded results that are consistent with a modest
elevation in risk that may increase with duration of use [57, 74, 75]. An addi-
tional adverse effect of progestin has also been posited, although available data
sources appear to be somewhat inconsistent [76–78].
Finally, the WHI is recruiting women older than those included in typical
randomized trials, with about two-thirds of the cohort over 60 years of age, and
trial follow-up will be longer than any previous trial. For example, considerable
evidence suggests that administration of hormones to women early in meno-
pause stabilizes bone mineral density, but there are many fewer pertinent data
about the effects of starting hormones later, especially over age 60. It is critical
to determine the overall beneﬁts and risks associated with long-term HRT
because the hypothesized beneﬁts for heart disease and fractures may accrue
primarily to long-term users, and hypothesized adverse effects on breast cancer
may increase with duration of use.
In summary, the potential bias introduced by the prescribing habits of the
preceding decades may be important; the effects of combined hormone replace-
ment therapy on cardiovascular disease and breast cancer must be carefully
assessed; and overall beneﬁts and risks of long-term hormone therapy need to
be assessed. None of these issues can be completely resolved by additional
observational studies. In fact, many expert observers have recommended that
a randomized trial of hormone replacement therapy with “hard” endpoints be
performed [69, 76, 79].
Exogenous ovarian steroid hormones have multiple target tissues in addition
to the bone, endometrium, vascular system, and breast, and hormone replace-
ment therapy has the potential to affect the risk of several additional conditions
[57]. Epidemiologic studies suggest the following potential associations: an
adverse effect on risk for cholelithiasis and systemic lupus erythematosis; a
beneﬁcial effect on risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease, as well
as stroke and colon cancer; and a putative increased risk of thromboembolic
disease. The WHI will monitor all of these conditions."

all reduction in risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events among postmenopausal
women with CHD. However, in the hormone group, findings did suggest a higher risk
of CHD events during the first year, and a decreased risk during years 3 to 5.
Objective TodetermineiftheriskreductionobservedinthelateryearsofHERSpersisted
and resulted in an overall reduced risk of CHD events with additional years of follow-up.
Design and Setting Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years’ du-
ration (HERS) and subsequent unblinded follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II) conducted
at outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.
Participants A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with CHD and average age
of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those surviving) consented
to follow-up in HERS II.
Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of con-
jugated estrogens and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=1380), or placebo
(n=1383) during HERS; open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal phy-
sicians’ discretion during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hor-
mones declined from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group, and in-
creased from 0% (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group.
Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction
and CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular events were coronary revascularization, hos-
pitalization for unstable angina or congestive heart failure, nonfatal ventricular arrhyth-
mia, sudden death, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease.
Results There were no significant decreases in rates of primary CHD events or sec-
ondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone group com-
pared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall."

a similar pattern of early increase in

domized to a high dose of conjugated
estrogens.14 Data from recent observa-
tional studies also suggest a possible
early increase in risk of CHD events re-
lated to postmenopausal hormone
therapy.15,16
An early increased risk for CHD
events might be due to prothrom-
botic, proinflammatory, or proarrhyth-
mic effects of hormones.17,18 This risk
may be limited to the first few years of
therapy if tolerance to the risk devel-
ops, or if susceptible individuals expe-
rience CHD events and are removed
from the at-risk cohort. We explored
multiple subgroups in HERS to deter-
mine if certain women classified by age,
prior manifestations of CHD, CHD risk
factors, medication use, or other fac-
tors, might be particularly at risk for an
early harm associated with hormone
use. Among 86 subgroups evaluated for
effect modification, there was no clear
evidence that early risk was limited to
specific subgroups.19 HERS substud-
ies that are ongoing will attempt to ad-
dress possible effect modification by
proinflammatory and genetic factors,
such as the prothrombin mutation
associated with higher risk of CHD
among hypertensive women taking
estrogen.20
We found an increased risk of non-
fatal ventricular arrhythmia among
women assigned to hormone therapy
in HERS II and overall. Most of these
events were ventricular arrhythmias
that required resuscitation. The signifi-
cance of this finding is unclear since
there was no associated increased risk
of sudden death, which is commonly
due to ventricular arrhythmia in per-
sons with CHD."

from the incidence in women randomly assigned to receive placebo. The pri-
mary analysis compares the rate of CHD events among women assigned to
active medication with the rate among women assigned to placebo using a
log-rank test for time to ﬁrst CHD event; treatment assignment is the only
predictor. The analysis will be by intention to treat, categorizing participants
according to treatment assignment, regardless of compliance. The validity of
the randomization will be assessed by comparing treatment and placebo groups
on the full range of baseline variables. Participants lost to follow-up will be
censored at the last date at which they are known to be alive without a recurrent
CHD event, and sensitivity analyses will be carried out to assess the potential
effects of informative censoring. The proportional hazards assumption will be
veriﬁed by testing for interaction between the treatment effect and follow-
up time.
Possible baseline predictors of study outcomes will be examined using Cox
models controlling for treatment assignment as well as baseline covariates."

S
trokes are an important cause of disability and death
among older women. Because many women use hormone
therapy for the control of perimenopausal symptoms and to
prevent osteoporosis after menopause, establishing whether
such therapy has other health effects is of considerable
clinical importance. A decision to use hormone therapy for
osteoporosis could be influenced, for example, by effects it
might have on other medical conditions, such as the risk of
heart disease and stroke.
See p 620
Based on observational studies, the effect of postmeno-
pausal hormone therapy on the risk of stroke is uncertain.
Recent case-control studies and cohort studies have reported
that postmenopausal hormone therapy increases,1 decreas-
es,2–6 or has no significant effect7–15 on stroke risk. Because
observational studies of postmenopausal hormone therapy
may be confounded by differences in the characteristics of
women who use postmenopausal hormones, eg, women who
use postmenopausal hormones tend to be healthier than
nonusers,16,17 clinical trial data are essential for discerning the
unconfounded relation between postmenopausal hormone
therapy and risk of stroke.
To examine the relation of postmenopausal hormone ther-
apy to risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), we
analyzed data collected from the Heart & Estrogen-progestin
Replacement Study (HERS), a secondary coronary heart
disease (CHD) prevention study among postmenopausal
women with known coronary artery disease.18 Stroke and TIA
were prespecified secondary outcomes. HERS is the first
clinical trial of postmenopausal hormone therapy to examine
whether such therapy affects the risk of TIAs and stroke.

ondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone group com-
pared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall. The unadjusted relative
hazard (RH) for CHD events in HERS was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-
1.22); HERS II, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77-1.29); and overall, 0.99 (0.84-1.17). The overall
RHs were similar after adjustment for potential confounders and differential use of
statins between treatment groups (RH, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82-1.14), and in analyses re-
stricted to women who were adherent to randomized treatment assignment (RH, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.77-1.19).
Conclusions Lower rates of CHD events among women in the hormone group in
the final years of HERS did not persist during additional years of follow-up. After 6.8
years, hormone therapy did not reduce risk of cardiovascular events in women with
CHD. Postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used to reduce risk for CHD
events in women with CHD.

58,WHI‐2002-2.pdf,0.8794237311227877,"Despite the apparent strength of the observational study reports, major
questions remain. First, observational studies are always subject to potential
bias. The studies of hormone replacement therapy have the potential for selec-
tion (or prescribing) bias. During the past 3 decades physicians in the United
States and Europe have received many negative and contradictory messages
about the safety of hormone replacement therapy, making it likely that women
who received estrogen were healthier than women who did not take estrogen
[64]. Estrogen users have been found to have a demographic proﬁle associated
with better health in at least two cohort studies [65, 66]. Although several
investigators have reported a beneﬁt of estrogen for heart disease after control-
ling for risk factors [58, 67], potential biases cannot be entirely eliminated in
this post hoc fashion.
Second, the effect of the combined estrogen plus progestin replacement on
coronary heart disease must be determined. Progestin is given in combination
with estrogen to women with a uterus in order to reduce the increased risk of
endometrial cancer that would otherwise be associated with unopposed estro-
gen [68]. Most epidemiologic data related to cardioprotective effect is based
on women who took unopposed estrogen. Progestin can have the effect of
reversing, or at least blunting, the lipid effects of estrogen that are presumed
to be beneﬁcial [5, 69, 70].
Estrogen stabilizes bone mineral density, and many observational studies
support a reduction in fracture rates [57]. Estrogen replacement therapy is
currently FDA-approved for both the prevention and the treatment of osteopo-
rosis. In observational studies, current users and long-time users of estrogen
appear to get the most beneﬁt [71, 72], but concern about the potential for
selection bias can again be raised [72]. Furthermore, the effect of combined
therapy has not been extensively studied. Finally, an accurate assessment of
the overall risks and beneﬁts of hormone replacement therapy are especially
important because of the availability of alternatives to estrogen for the treatment
of osteoporosis [73].

 Such
questions have made it difficult for women and their
physicians to know how to respond to these results.
To clarify the role of estrogen in the secondary pre-
vention of heart disease, more information is needed
about its effects on the underlying disease process —
coronary atherosclerosis — and the extent to which
medroxyprogesterone acetate may modify the effects
of estrogen.
The Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis tri-
al is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial that has examined the effects of hormone-
replacement therapy on the progression of coronary
atherosclerosis in women. A total of 309 postmeno-
pausal women who had angiographically verified cor-
onary artery disease at base line were randomly as-
signed to receive unopposed estrogen, estrogen plus
medroxyprogesterone acetate, or placebo and were
scheduled for coronary angiography about three years
after randomization. In this report we describe the
effects of treatment on the progression of coronary
atherosclerosis as measured by quantitative coronary
angiography.
 
METHODS
 
Subjects
 
The study design was approved by institutional review boards
at the participating sites and has been described in detail else-
where.
 
13
 
 Between January 1995 and December 1996, women were
recruited at one of six clinical sites (see the Appendix). Women
were eligible if they were postmenopausal, were not currently re-
ceiving estrogen-replacement treatment, and had one or more
epicardial coronary stenoses of at least 30 percent of the luminal
diameter, as measured by quantitative coronary angiography."

ing the first year of treatment, with a

Women’s Estrogen for Stroke Trial
(WEST), an increase in stroke with
HRT was seen during the first 6 months
of treatment.28 This increase in risk early
after initiation of HRT may account for
the adverse effect of HRT in WAVE,
since the mean duration of follow-up
was 2.8 years. In the predominantly

64,HERS-1.pdf,0.8780913269805741,"Possible baseline predictors of study outcomes will be examined using Cox
models controlling for treatment assignment as well as baseline covariates.
Potential mediators of the treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the
estimated relative hazard for treatment in a Cox model adjusted for the pro-
posed mediator (measured after randomization) to the corresponding estimate
from an unadjusted model. Attenuation of the estimated relative hazard for
treatment would be consistent with a mediating effect. Secondary analyses
of more broadly deﬁned CHD endpoints, all-cause mortality, and outcomes
possibly related to HRT (such as breast cancer, gallbladder disease, deep-vein
thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism) will also be carried out using unadjusted
Cox models. Treatment effects on common recurrent events, in particular unsta-
ble angina, will be analyzed using the Anderson-Gill extension of the Cox
model [12].
Sample Size Estimates
Although we will use proportional hazards models for the primary analysis,
we approximated sample size using standard formulae for two-group compari-
sons of proportions, with assumptions noted in Table 4. The expectation of a
5% per year CHD event rate in the placebo group was based on data from
several observational studies and intervention trials in women with CHD [5,
13–18]. To ensure conservative estimates, we relied primarily on CHD event

rates among women in recent randomized trials, as these rates tend to be lower
than recurrence rates in the general population.
How estrogen might prevent coronary events is not clear, but at least part
of the effect may be through an improved lipoprotein proﬁle [8]. We estimated
that half of the protective effect of hormone therapy is due to changes in lipid
levels [19, 20] that alter CHD rates only after a lag time of 2 years. Loss of
follow-up and deaths due to non-CHD causes were assumed to occur in 2%
of participants per year. The proportion with events in the hormone-treated
groups was adjusted to reﬂect the expected number of person-years on each
of the treatments after incorporating the crossover and lag-time assumptions
listed in Table 4."

Background: Although observational studies suggest that estro-

and mortality in postmenopausal women, use of unopposed ERT
for prevention of coronary heart disease in healthy postmeno-
pausal women remains untested.
Objective: To determine the effects of unopposed ERT on the
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy postmeno-
pausal women without preexisting cardiovascular disease.
Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting: University-based clinic.
Patients: 222 postmenopausal women 45 years of age or older
without preexisting cardiovascular disease and with low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 3.37 mmol/L or greater (>130
mg/dL).
Intervention: Unopposed micronized 17b-estradiol (1 mg/d) or
placebo. All women received dietary counseling. Women received
lipid-lowering medication if their low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol level exceeded 4.15 mmol/L (160 mg/dL).
Measurements: The rate of change in intima–media thickness of
the right distal common carotid artery far wall in computer image
processed B-mode ultrasonograms obtained at baseline and every
6 months during the 2-year trial.
Results: In a multivariable mixed-effects model, among women
who had at least one follow-up measurement of carotid intima–
media thickness (n 5 199), the average rate of progression of
subclinical atherosclerosis was lower in those taking unopposed
estradiol than in those taking placebo (20.0017 mm/y vs."
71,EVTET.pdf,0.8756022863110412,"The incidence of
VTE was 10.7% in the HRT group and 2.3% in the placebo group. In
the HRT group, all events happened within 261 days after inclusion.
The sequential design did not stop the study, but strongly indicated a
difference between the two groups. Our data strongly suggests that 
women who have previously suffered a VTE have an increased risk of
recurrence on HRT. This treatment should therefore be avoided in this
patient group if possible. The results also support those of  recent 
epidemiological studies, which also indicate increased risk of VTE in
non-selected female populations during HRT. 
Introduction
An increasing number of women are eligible for hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT), but the evaluation of the benefits and 
hazards of HRT still needs further investigation. The relief of 
climacteric symptoms, which improves quality of life, is recognized
(1), and also the prevention of osteoporosis (2-4). HRT may on the
other hand adversely increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancers
(5, 6).
Numerous epidemiological studies strongly suggest that HRT may
reduce the risk of arterial vascular thrombosis (7). However, the first
randomized trial, the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study
(HERS), did not confirm a reduction in the overall rate of coronary
heart disease events in women with established coronary artery disease
(8).
The evidence on the effect of HRT on the risk of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) is contradictory. Early epidemiological 
studies failed to show an increased risk of VTE among users (9-13), but
recent studies suggest a 2-4 fold increased risk for current users 
(14-19). Five recent review articles have re-evaluated the risk 
associated with HRT use and the authors unanimously conclude that an
association may exist, but that further investigations are required and
clinical trials warranted (20-24).  
The present randomized clinical trial was initiated to test whether
estradiol treatment influences the risk of VTE.  We chose to study 
individuals at high risk, since the much higher incidence of VTE in 
these individuals might help to detect a clinically relevant effect with a
much smaller sample size than would have been required for low-risk
females."

Clinical sites obtained institutional

a new informed consent document.
Baseline and Follow-up
At baseline in HERS, we obtained in-
formation on demographics, reproduc-
tive and health history, risk factors for
CHD, quality of life, and medication
use. Participants underwent physical
examination including breast and pel-
vic examinations with Papanicolaou
tests and endometrial evaluations,
screening mammography, standard-
ized 12-lead electrocardiograms
(ECGs), and measurement of fasting li-
poprotein cholesterol levels.1
During HERS, participants visited the
clinic every 4 months to receive study
medication and for ascertainment of
cardiovascular and other events, ad-
verse effects, and study medication ad-
herence. Annually and at the final HERS
visit, which took place an average of 4
months before enrollment in HERS II,
all baseline measures except demo-
graphics and health history were re-
peated. During HERS II, participants
were telephoned at 4-month intervals
and asked about cardiovascular and
other outcomes using the same ques-
tions used during HERS visits."

secondary outcomes were rare, with wide CIs around the
risk ratios. These results suggest than the decision to use
unopposed oestrogen in a randomised clinical trial, with
careful management of bleeding, was not inappropriate,
even in women with an intact uterus. This decision does
not, however, endorse the use of unopposed oestrogen in
other circumstances in women who have not had a
hysterectomy.
This trial did not have the power to detect small
differences in risk, hence limiting the inferences that can be
drawn. However, the value of a point estimate, the most
plausible single value in light of the observed data, is
consistent with a small beneficial effect of unopposed
oestrogen (oestradiol) in postmenopausal women when
taken immediately after a first myocardial infarction. The
point estimate for the combined outcome of reinfarction or
cardiac death, however, indicates no benefit. Thus,
ESPRIT provides insufficient evidence of benefit to alter
current guidance against the use of HRT for the secondary
prevention of cardiovascular disease.31

77,WAWE.pdf,0.8744607907278941,"Limitations of the Trial
Approximately 20% of our patients did
notcontributetothestudyendpointbe-
cause they did not have follow-up an-
giography or interim events. Among the
women with angiographic follow-up,
those assigned to active HRT took only
67% of the prescribed medication, com-
pared with 84% in the active vitamin
group. These 2 factors limit the power
of our study to detect a treatment effect,
particularly for HRT. However, among
women who were taking HRT or HRT
placebotreatmentat12months,riskwas
increased in the active HRT group
(P=.04).
The primary end point of our trial was
a change in coronary artery dimen-
sions, with the worst angiographic out-
come imputed to patients who died or
suffered interim infarctions. Coronary
progression has been shown in previ-
ous angiographic trials to be a strong,
independent predictor of future coro-
nary events,33,34 and thus should be a
valid surrogate end point. Imputing an
unfavorable angiographic outcome to
patients with interim events avoids the
problem inherent in ignoring the out-
comes of these patients for the primary
end point of the trial.
Clinical Implications
The results of this trial add to the accu-
mulating evidence that neither HRT nor
antioxidant vitamin supplements im-
provetheclinicalcourseofcoronarydis-
easeinpostmenopausalwomen.Thisin-
formation is important because both of
these treatments are commonly used in
this circumstance, with the expecta-
tion of benefit, based on observational
data and theoretical concepts.
Furthermore, these results strengthen
the evidence that HRT causes cardio-
vascular harm during the first year or
2 of treatment. The increase in total and
cardiovascular mortality in women tak-
ing high doses of vitamins C and E was
unexpected."

METHODS
Study Participants and Baseline
Measurements
The design and methods of HERS and
HERSIIhavebeendescribed.1,6,7Briefly,
participants were postmenopausal
women younger than 80 years at base-
line with coronary artery disease and no
prior hysterectomy. Among the reasons

thrombosisorpulmonaryembolism,his-
toryofbreastcancer,endometrialhyper-
plasia or cancer, abnormal Papanico-
laou (Pap) result, any hormone use
within the past 3 months, and disease
judged likely to be fatal within 4 years.
During the baseline period of HERS
we obtained information by question-
naire and interview, and participants
underwent physical examination, in-
cluding pelvic examination with Pap
smear and endometrial evaluation and
screening mammography. All base-
line measures except demographics and
health history were repeated at the fi-
nal HERS visit, an average of 4 months
before enrollment in HERS II.
Treatment, Follow-up,
and Outcomes
DuringtheHERStrial,womenwereran-
domly allocated to receive either 0.625
mg/d of conjugated estrogen plus 2.5
mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate or
an identical placebo. After stopping
blinded medications at the end of the
HERS trial, decisions about whether to
undertakeopen-labelhormonetherapy
were left to the women and their per-
sonal physicians. During HERS II par-
ticipants were called at 4-month inter-
vals and asked about hormone therapy
andaboutsymptomsorclinicalencoun-
ters for possible disease events1; assess-
ment of lipid-lowering drugs (but not
bisphosphonates) was also continued
during HERS II."

Most of the women (62%) were past or current smokers, with 13% reporting
that they currently smoked cigarettes regularly (Table 7). The mean number

DISCUSSION
Coronary disease is the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women.
Extensive observational evidence indicates that estrogen therapy reduces risk
for CHD, but these ﬁndings might be due to confounding factors if women
who choose to take estrogen are healthier than those who do not. Only a
randomized trial can answer this question, and we believe that evidence from a
randomized trial is necessary before recommending postmenopausal hormone
therapy to prevent CHD.
The HERS is a secondary prevention trial in postmenopausal women with
documented CHD."

ABSTRACT: The Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) trial is a three-arm, random-
ized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the effects of estrogen replace-
ment therapy (0.625 mg/day oral conjugated estrogen) with or without continuous
low-dose progestin (2.5 mg oral medroxyprogesterone acetate/day) versus placebo
on progression of atherosclerosis. A total of 309 postmenopausal women at ﬁve sites
underwent baseline coronary angiography and were randomized. Participants will have
repeat coronary angiography after an average of 3.25 years of treatment. The primary
outcome of interest will be change in minimum diameter of the major epicardial seg-
ments, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. The primary aim is to test
the hypothesis that either form of hormone therapy will slow the progression or induce
regression of coronary atherosclerosis compared to placebo. The secondary aims are to
assess the effects of the two treatments versus placebo on endothelial function (measured
using ﬂow-mediated vasodilator responses), on several presumed mediators of estro-
gen’s effect on atherosclerosis (i.e., plasma lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure,
glucose metabolism, hemostatic factors, and antioxidant activity), on other factors that
inﬂuence the development of coronary heart disease (i.e., diet, smoking status, exercise,
weight, and health-related quality of life issues), and on clinical cardiovascular events."

daily servings of vegetables and fruits to at least ﬁve and of grain products to at

the HRT component assumes that 45% of women will be post-hysterectomy at
randomization, in which case there is a 1;1 randomized double-blind allocation
between conjugated equine estrogen (ERT) 0.625 mg/day or placebo. The re-

to 1;1 to this same preparation of estrogen plus continuous 2.5 mg/day of

Discussion
In this clinical trial, postmenopausal women younger than 70 years
of age with prior VTE receiving continuous HRT had an increased risk
of recurrent VTE. This is the first-ever randomized trial on the effect of
HRT with VTE as a primary end-point. Our results are only valid for
women with previous VTE, but they support the evidence of an early
excess risk of VTE associated with use of HRT detected in recent 
epidemiological studies on healthy women (14-19) and with the excess
incidence of VTE events observed in the randomized HERS-study (8).
The estimated 2-4 fold relative increased risk for VTE among HRT
users is of the same magnitude as the risk associated with oral contra-
ceptive use. Since the baseline incidence of VTE is much higher in
postmenopausal women than in women of reproductive age, HRT may
lead to a considerably higher number of women developing VTE 
(absolute risk) than does oral contraceptive use. In populations with
high use of HRT, its impact on the overall frequency of VTE could 
therefore be substantial. 
Our study is too small to carry out subgroup analysis, but it is known
that two clinical factors appear to be important for the risk of recurrent
thrombosis: presence or absence of transient risk factors for VTE 
(26, 28, 33-35) and the time elapsed since VTE. Our treatment groups
were similar with regard to risk factors for VTE. Neither did time from
previous VTE to inclusion in the study show statistically significant
difference between groups.
The rate of identified thrombophilia was low. Only 35 (25%) had
hereditary or acquired thrombophilia, which is lower than that reported
in recent studies (27, 36). The reason for this may be due to patient 
selection. Women with recognized deficiencies or defects may have 
hesitated to take part in the study. Our study population may therefore
represent a group at lower risk than an unselected population with 
previous VTE."
89,ERA-1.pdf,0.8712361222639351,"Another possible explanation for our results is that
estrogen is more effective in preventing the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis than in slowing the progres-
sion of disease once it is established. In ovariectomized
monkeys and rabbits in which atherosclerosis has not
yet developed, estrogen inhibits the development of
disease,29,30 yet similar studies in animals with estab-
lished disease have shown no effect on progression.15,31
In animals, the ability of estrogen to prevent the accu-
mulation of cholesterol in the vessel wall appears to re-
quire a healthy endothelium.32 Since atherosclerosis
and aging are associated with impaired endothelial
function,33 older women or women with established
disease may be less likely to realize a cardiovascular
benefit from estrogen. The Women’s Health Initia-
tive, a large clinical trial in predominantly healthy
women, will provide important data about estrogen
use for the primary prevention of heart disease.34
As in any clinical trial of the prevention of chronic
disease, the conclusions of this study would be strong-
er with more subjects and longer follow-up. However,
the nearly identical rates of disease progression among
the three groups after a mean of 3.2 years offer little
reason to suspect that a significant difference would
emerge with longer follow-up. Furthermore, the 95
percent confidence limits for the differences between
the active-treatment and placebo groups in measures
of minimal diameter at follow-up exclude benefits
greater than 0.021 mm for estrogen plus medroxy-
progesterone acetate and 0.049 mm for unopposed
estrogen. 
Side effects, such as vaginal bleeding, especially in
the group receiving unopposed estrogen, produced
differential rates of compliance and opportunities
for unblinding. However, the results of analyses of
the subjects who complied with treatment were vir-
tually identical to intention-to-treat analyses, and as-
sessments of angiograms and clinical cardiovascular
events were performed by persons who had no con-
tact with the women or knowledge of the treatment
assignments. Despite random assignment to treat-
ment, there was a nonsignificant trend toward more
severe disease at base line among women assigned to
combined therapy. Therefore, follow-up angiographic
measures were compared after adjustment for base-
line measurements."
90,EPAT.pdf,0.8710751024566358,"The three
studies not only had different end points (intima–media
thickness vs. events and coronary angiography) but also
had at least three other important differences. First,
EPAT
was
conducted
in
healthy
postmenopausal
women without symptoms of cardiovascular disease
(primary prevention), whereas HERS and ERA were
conducted in women with preexisting coronary heart
disease (secondary prevention). Second, 17b-estradiol
was used in EPAT, whereas conjugated equine estrogen
was used in HERS and ERA. Conjugated equine estro-
gen, a mixture of many steroidal compounds derived
from the urine of pregnant horses, and 17b-estradiol,
the endogenous human hormone, differ greatly. Ran-
domized, controlled trials are needed to determine
whether other estrogen compounds have the same ben-
eﬁcial effect on subclinical atherosclerosis as does unop-
posed 17b-estradiol. Finally, participants in EPAT were
younger than participants in HERS and ERA, and the
time from menopause to randomization was approxi-
mately 10 years shorter in EPAT. Early intervention in
the progression of atherosclerosis, especially at the start
of menopause, may be the key to successful prevention
of cardiovascular disease with HRT. Because nonevalu-
able participants were younger than evaluable partici-
pants, the treatment beneﬁt in EPAT might have been
greater if these participants had completed the trial.
Use of proven atherosclerosis- and event-reducing
therapies in addition to the study therapy is inevitable in
cardiovascular end point studies of secondary preven-
tion. In HERS and ERA, more than 50% of participants

 Thus, it was a sur-
prise when the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Re-
placement Study found no overall effect of 4.1 years
of treatment with conjugated estrogen plus medroxy-
progesterone acetate on the risk of nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction and death from coronary heart disease
among women with established coronary atheroscle-
rosis.

 These results were complicated by an early in-
crease and a late reduction in risk within the overall
null effect.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain
these results. Some have argued that a single, relative-
ly short clinical trial may not reliably predict long-
term benefit, especially when so much a priori evi-
dence suggests that estrogen should be beneficial.
 
9,10
 
Others have wondered whether the favorable effects
of estrogen are attenuated by medroxyprogesterone
acetate.

terol within the vessel wall), and other
mechanisms have been demonstrated in
animal experiments, including preser-
vation of nitric oxide activity, inhibi-
tion of leukocyte adhesion, reduction of
cellular oxidative injury, and inhibition
of platelet adhesion.18
Five randomized, placebo-con-
trolled trials of vitamin E in patients
with or at risk for coronary disease have
been completed,19-23 and all but the

94,HERS II-1.pdf,0.8706649988350835,"Given the absence of overall long-
term benefit of hormone therapy, there
remain important questions about the
pattern of CHD events over time in
HERS and HERS II. The RH for CHD
events in the hormone group was higher
in the first year of treatment and lower
in the fourth year, but based on the en-
tire 6.8 years of follow-up, there was no
trend over time (continuous trend over
time, P=.18). These results raise the
possibility that the early increase in risk
of CHD events observed in HERS, as
well as the decrease in risk during years
3 to 5, may have occurred by chance.
However, in this post-hoc analysis, the
relative risk in the first year of hor-
mone therapy is statistically higher than
the average relative risk over the re-
mainder of follow-up in the intention-
to-treat analysis (P=.03). Other ran-
domized trials have also reported an
early increase in risk of CHD events re-
lated to postmenopausal hormone
therapy.11 Preliminary results from the
Women’s Health Initiative random-
ized trial of the effect of hormone
therapy among 27347 women, few of

at least one 15% to 75% coronary stenosis at baseline coronary angiography. The
trial was conducted from July 1997 to January 2002 in 7 clinical centers in the United

Background
 
Heart disease is a major cause of ill-
ness and death in women. To understand better the
role of estrogen in the treatment and prevention of
heart disease, more information is needed about its
effects on coronary atherosclerosis and the extent
to which concomitant progestin therapy may modify
these effects.
 
Methods
 
We randomly assigned a total of 309 wom-
en with angiographically verified coronary disease  to
receive 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen per day,
0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen plus 2.5 mg of med-
roxyprogesterone acetate per day, or placebo. The
women were followed for a mean (±SD) of 3.2±0.6
years. Base-line and follow-up coronary angiograms
were analyzed by quantitative methods."
