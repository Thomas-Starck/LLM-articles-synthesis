Effective measures to slow its pro-\ngression in both women and men are still urgently\nneeded. Several lines of evidence suggest that estro-\ngen replacement should be beneficial in postmeno-\npausal women. However, our results indicate that a\nmean of 3.2 years of estrogen replacement did not\nslow the progression of coronary atherosclerotic le-\nsions in women.

In ovariectomized\nmonkeys and rabbits in which atherosclerosis has not\nyet developed, estrogen inhibits the development of\ndisease,29,30 yet similar studies in animals with estab-\nlished disease have shown no effect on progression.15,31\nIn animals, the ability of estrogen to prevent the accu-\nmulation of cholesterol in the vessel wall appears to re-\nquire a healthy endothelium.32 Since atherosclerosis\nand aging are associated with impaired endothelial\nfunction,33 older women or women with established\ndisease may be less likely to realize a cardiovascular\nbenefit from estrogen. The Women\u2019s Health Initia-\ntive, a large clinical trial in predominantly healthy\nwomen, will provide important data about estrogen\nuse for the primary prevention of heart disease.34\nAs in any clinical trial of the prevention of chronic\ndisease, the conclusions of this study would be strong-\ner with more subjects and longer follow-up. However,\nthe nearly identical rates of disease progression among\nthe three groups after a mean of 3.2 years offer little\nreason to suspect that a significant difference would\nemerge with longer follow-up. Furthermore, the 95\npercent confidence limits for the differences between\nthe active-treatment and placebo groups in measures\nof minimal diameter at follow-up exclude benefits\ngreater than 0.021 mm for estrogen plus medroxy-\nprogesterone acetate and 0.049 mm for unopposed\nestrogen. \nSide effects, such as vaginal bleeding, especially in\nthe group receiving unopposed estrogen, produced\ndifferential rates of compliance and opportunities\nfor unblinding. However, the results of analyses of\nthe subjects who complied with treatment were vir-\ntually identical to intention-to-treat analyses, and as-\nsessments of angiograms and clinical cardiovascular\nevents were performed by persons who had no con-\ntact with the women or knowledge of the treatment\nassignments.

These data are consistent with the\noverall null effect of estrogen plus medroxyproges-\nterone acetate on clinical events in the Heart and Es-\ntrogen/Progestin Replacement Study.

The primary\noutcome of interest will be change in minimum diameter of the major epicardial seg-\nments, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. The primary aim is to test\nthe hypothesis that either form of hormone therapy will slow the progression or induce\nregression of coronary atherosclerosis compared to placebo.

In epidemiologic meta-analyses [8\u201310], long-term use of postmenopausal\nestrogen was associated with a 50% lower risk of CVD. The relationship ob-\nserved between estrogen replacement and CHD risk is even more striking in\nolder women with coronary artery disease [11, 12].\nDespite the observational data suggesting estrogen\u2019s cardioprotective effect,\nits actual bene\ufb01ts and risks have not been fully evaluated. In 1998, the Heart\nand Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) showed no bene\ufb01t of 4.1\nyears of estrogen plus progestin therapy for secondary prevention of heart\ndisease in postmenopausal women [13]. Within the overall null effect, there\nwas a reduction in risk after 2 years of treatment unexpectedly offset by an\nincreased risk during the \ufb01rst year. It remains unclear whether this pattern of\nchanging risk over time was simply a chance occurrence combined with no\nreal effect of the regimen, or due to an early adverse and late bene\ufb01cial effect\nof the regimen.\nA major question concerning the HERS trial results is whether the addition\nof the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Proverat) blocked estro-\ngen\u2019s cardioprotective effects. Currently, clinicians administer a progestin with\nestrogen to prevent unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial carcinoma in\nwomen with intact uteri. However, MPA and 19-nor testosterone progestins\nblunt the favorable changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)\nassociated with estrogen use [14, 15]. Furthermore, in nonhuman primates,\ncontinuous low-dose MPA substantially reduced estrogen\u2019s favorable effect\non the progression of coronary atherosclerosis [16]. On the other hand, the\nattenuation of estrogen-induced increases in HDL-C may be offset by the pro-\ngestins\u2019 protection against estrogen-induced increases in triglycerides and fac-\ntor VII [17, 18].

If the probability that a response\nis missing depends on covariate information but not on the response\u2019s value,\nthe data are said to be missing at random.

In the \ufb01rst case, although the missingness for a particular\nsegment is not directly related to the stenosis in that segment, it is caused by\na large amount of stenosis in a proximal site. As stenosis within a patient is\nmore homogeneous than between patients, this value is not missing at random.\nIn the second case, the physical alteration of a segment causes its subsequent\nmeasurement to be unre\ufb02ective of the natural progression of atherosclerosis,\nespecially when the intervention was prompted by disease symptoms. It may\nalso cause measurements of distal segments to be unrepresentative of the\ndisease process.\nSegments that are completely stenosed will be included in the analysis.\nValues missing due to a proximal occlusion will be treated several ways and\neach resulting dataset analyzed separately.

We planned several steps to minimize\ndropouts and maximize compliance. These include a simple study regimen,\nplacebo run-in, careful attention to informed consent, frequent use of reminder\nphone calls and postcards, providing transportation or travel reimbursement\nwhen needed, annual social events, a quarterly newsletter, ERA brochures and\nwallet cards, and careful monitoring of retention during the trial. These methods\nhave been successfully employed to achieve excellent retention rates in several\nrecent clinical trials at our institution.\nHypercholesterolemia in ERA Participants\nPerhaps the most dif\ufb01cult question concerning risk-factor control for the\nERA trial was whether to treat elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(LDL-C) or low HDL-C. The importance of this question is accentuated by\nthe National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel\nguidelines [44] for management of elevated LDL-C in patients with coronary\nartery disease. However, after careful consideration, and consultation from\nmany experts (including two members of the NCEP panel), we decided not to\ninclude a formal lipid-lowering intervention in the ERA trial participants with\nelevated LDL-C. There are three reasons for this decision: (1) Most of the data\nused to support the NCEP guidelines were derived from studies of middle-\naged men, and their applicability to postmenopausal women is unclear. In fact,\ndata from the Lipid Research Clinics suggest that LDL-C shows no association\nwith CVD risk in postmenopausal women [4]. (2) LDL-C may be in the causal\nchain between estrogen use and prevention of atherosclerosis; thus, a lipid-\nlowering intervention could bias a hormone replacement treatment effect and/\nor obscure differences between the opposed and unopposed regimens.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 53953, "end_char_idx": 56202, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dff0153-5119-4599-9578-4b3061aa492e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dff0153-5119-4599-9578-4b3061aa492e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ERA-2.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7564eb6350f996d53fb0069f445b3b6c88404aafcaa9ebbb089c370250011add", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3b94bfe-7d31-4bf6-b81f-4e4732511d1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e483e92116edc47f29e38fb2ffe1f3282fb0e635c4553a671993c7426b69a3b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b720ad23-172b-4f4a-9c05-222a7a4f344e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "397f112cfe363c30045f0015c7b06aea18951ae156ef0e47fcf64b153e116c84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(3)\nLess than half of all postmenopausal women with elevated cholesterol in our\ngeographic area were being treated with drug therapy when ERA began.

All ERA participants will have\nannual pelvic examinations whether or not they have a uterus, and all women\nwith a uterus will have annual endometrial evaluations regardless of treat-\nment assignment.\nUnblinding Procedures\nUnblinding is kept to an absolute minimum.

However, the degree to which endothelial function is\ncorrelated with actual progression of coronary disease remains to be seen.

Whether estrogen\nplus progestin causes an early increase in CHD risk, as suggested in HERS,\nwill not be easily evaluated in the ERA trial because of the few anticipated\nclinical events.

The WHI was initiated in 1992, with a planned\ncompletion date of 2007. Postmenopausal women ranging in age from 50 to 79 are\nenrolled at one of 40 WHI clinical centers nationwide into either a clinical trial (CT)\nthat will include about 64,500 women or an observational study (OS) that will include\nabout 100,000 women. The CT is designed to allow randomized controlled evaluation\nof three distinct interventions: a low-fat eating pattern, hypothesized to prevent breast\ncancer and colorectal cancer and, secondarily, coronary heart disease; hormone replace-\nment therapy, hypothesized to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and other\ncardiovascular diseases and, secondarily, to reduce the risk of hip and other fractures,\nwith increased breast cancer risk as a possible adverse outcome; and calcium and vitamin\nD supplementation, hypothesized to prevent hip fractures and, secondarily, other frac-\ntures and colorectal cancer.\nOverall bene\ufb01t-versus-risk assessment is a central focus in each of the three CT\ncomponents. Women are screened for participation in one or both of the components\u2014\ndietary modi\ufb01cation (DM) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u2014of the CT, which\nwill randomize 48,000 and 27,500 women, respectively. Women who prove to be ineligi-\nble for, or who are unwilling to enroll in, these CT components are invited to enroll in\nthe OS.

Documented breast cancer risk factors, including\nage at menarche, adult height, and postmenopausal body mass, suggest that\nadult and early nutrition each may exert its own in\ufb02uences. A breast cancer\nprevention hypothesis [9] motivated the series of NCI-sponsored feasibility\nstudies mentioned above.\nThe extent to which modi\ufb01cations of the diet alone can reduce cancer inci-\ndence has been studied for at least 5 decades. Rodent feeding experiments\ndating back to the 1940s [10] indicate a promoting role for both total calorie\nconsumption and for fat calorie consumption speci\ufb01cally, in mammary tumori-\ngenesis [11\u201313]. Tumors are promoted in older as well as in immature female\nanimals [14]. Consumption of both polyunsaturated and saturated fat appears\nto be related to mammary tumor risk [15, 16]. Increased consumption of either\nsaturated or polyunsaturated fat increases circulating levels of reproductive\nhormones in older female primates [17]. In comparison, rodent feeding studies\npoint to a more consistent role for saturated fat consumption in colonic tumori-\ngenesis [18].\nEpidemiologic study of these associations began in the 1970s.

More recent analyses of this type [19\u201322] indicate similar\nstrong relationships between the cancer incidence rates of breast, colon, rectum,\novary, and endometrium among women ages 50 to 69 and per capita fat supply,\nwith corresponding relationships among males for cancers of the colon, rectum\nand prostate. Such analyses also suggest an association between breast cancer\nrisk and both saturated fat and, particularly, polyunsaturated fat, while the\ncorresponding colon cancer association is primarily with saturated fat. These\nassociations are supported by analyses relating changes in fat supply within\ncountries and corresponding lagged changes in cancer incidence rates [22].\nThe animal experiments and ecologic studies stimulated a substantial num-\nber of case-control and cohort studies of these same associations, beginning in\nthe middle to late 1970s. Howe et al [23] presented a combined analysis of the\ndata from 12 breast cancer case-control studies involving several thousand\ncases and controls. They reported a highly signi\ufb01cant positive relationship\nbetween postmenopausal breast cancer risk and estimated fat intake, though\nthey interpreted the magnitude of the association to be less than that projected\nfrom the international data analyses.

There is even\nsome supportive data on migrants from high-fat- to low-fat-consuming coun-\ntries [31]. In contrast, analytic epidemiologic studies, which are usually re-\ngarded as yielding more reliable epidemiologic data, have often yielded weak\nor equivocal results.\nEach of these types of observational studies has substantial methodologic\nlimitations. The ecologic studies involve crude dietary measurements and avail-\nable data have not allowed a careful attempt to control confounding. On the\nother hand, such studies have included populations with widely varying dietary\nhabits and a dietary measure that re\ufb02ects average nutrient availability for tens\nof thousands of persons in each country. In contrast, cohort and case-control\nstudies of these associations have generally taken place within populations\nhaving a modest range of fat intake and have involved assessment instruments\nhaving substantial random measurement error [32] along with likely important\nsystematic errors [33, 34]. These features combine to yield results of unknown\nreliability from both ecologic and analytic data sources [35].\nIn view of the preceding discussion, one can view the dietary fat reduction\nand breast and colon cancer prevention as strong hypotheses in the sense that\nthere are various sources of data suggesting effects of substantial importance to\npublic health. However, these hypotheses and, more speci\ufb01cally, the hypothesis\nthat a change in the diet of postmenopausal women can in\ufb02uence the subse-\nquent risk for these diseases have not yet been tested.

The diseases targeted for\nprevention, including coronary heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer,\nand osteoporotic fractures, are among the most common causes of morbidity\nand mortality in middle-aged and older women. While the sample size for\neach component of the CT was selected to ensure suf\ufb01ciently precise interven-\ntion effects, information on designated primary outcomes, CT monitoring, and\nreporting activities will also focus on overall bene\ufb01t-to-risk assessment and on\nanswering the questions of whether or not, and which, women should under-\ntake the study interventions.\nThe low-fat eating pattern being tested in the WHI follows decades of obser-\nvational study indicating that some elements of a Western lifestyle contribute\nto highly elevated rates of breast, colorectal, and other cancers and of coronary\nheart disease and other vascular diseases in women. Whether or not a high-\nfat eating pattern is responsible for an important fraction of such elevation is\ndif\ufb01cult to establish using nonexperimental methods, and it would be virtually\nimpossible to determine whether or not a major dietary change in the middle\nand later decades of life can reduce the risk of these diseases without an\nappropriate randomized dietary intervention trial.\nOpinions concerning the bene\ufb01ts and risks of hormone replacement therapy\nhave \ufb02uctuated greatly over the past 25 years, during which time there has been\nsubstantial evolution in choice of preparation and dosages.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 100820, "end_char_idx": 103097, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd5123db-15e7-4b73-b102-9bc9ef419ab3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd5123db-15e7-4b73-b102-9bc9ef419ab3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "WHI\u20102002-2.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec05055a9c24016a512b6e6e50bcb87957ae18089b11016359915bf768fc9437", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1505976-fc6a-47da-b1bd-82906f170833", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4c649fe45b12f1d77791c3c536110d0241548861b9f5c52921ed2198d5a934a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee40f333-d569-4310-812b-8fc576ac5653", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7299dc8ec3966c5cb8ce9fd8cccc48bf1624f7d7f74735e8a2767a62c7f7c149", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Opinions concerning the bene\ufb01ts and risks of hormone replacement therapy\nhave \ufb02uctuated greatly over the past 25 years, during which time there has been\nsubstantial evolution in choice of preparation and dosages.

Methods: Sixty\npostmenopausal women with coronary artery disease were randomized into three groups: one group received\ntransdermal 17b-estradiol at a dose of 50 mg per 24 h alone for 18 days followed by 10 days of combined treatment\nwith medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 5 mg orally; the second group received placebo and the third group\nreceived conjugated estrogens orally for 18 days followed by a combined treatment with MPA for 10 days. Clinical\nevaluations were performed at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months.

Introduction\nOne of the earliest positive reports of the effects\nof estrogen on the cardiovascular system was a\nstudy\nin\nestrogen\ndepleted\nfemale\noophorec-\ntomized cynomolgous monkeys. They were all on\ncholesterol-rich diet and those given estrogen re-\nplacement therapy developed much less coronary\nartheromathosis compared with the others [1].\nAfter that, several reports from large observa-\ntional and epidemiological studies show that hor-\nmonal replacement therapy (HRT) to healthy\npostmenopausal women has bene\ufb01cial effects on\nmorbidity and mortality in coronary artery dis-\nease\n[2,3].\nHowever,\ndata\nfrom\nrandomized\nprospective placebo controlled studies are still\nmissing. Recent retrospective data has pointed out\na slightly increased risk of venous thromboem-\nbolism in women using HRT [4\u20136].

Discussion\nThis is the \ufb01rst prospective relatively long-term\nrandomized study, where the effects on angina\npectoris, compliance and quality of life in post-\nmenopausal women with coronary artery disease\nhas been studied. Sixty women were randomized\nto either estrogen patch, estrogen tablets or con-\nventional medium potent doses. Gestagen was\nadded for 10 days of each 28 day treatment\nperiod. All patients suffered from rather advanced\ncoronary artery disease and 70% had symptoms\nof angina pectoris at baseline. No harmful effects\non angina pectoris were induced by HRT as com-\npared with placebo during 12 months treatment.\nOne would have expected positive effects of HRT\non angina pectoris, because of positive case re-\nports [12]. In our study a positive effect might\nhave been masked by the actions on the arterial\nwall of the comprehensive mediation (nitrates,\nbeta-blockers,\ncalcium-channel\nblockers,\netc.).\nAgainst this points the fact that no change took\nplace in medication during the year.\nIn women suffering from Syndrome-X (i.e.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12707, "end_char_idx": 14426, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c88cd15a-1fb7-4030-8a91-29fe98c4ac81": {"__data__": {"id_": "c88cd15a-1fb7-4030-8a91-29fe98c4ac81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HALL.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "849d27a7f2768063b2e34dcf7a2a503b53f0969e5b9de8cf4d5c1b25bcfc6cb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8b96fac-7df1-4287-955b-15a18349390a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6814dc614e2d2fdff5dcc6abc58a96f47fb4ecd93d9697baf9b15bb551be7a48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a453520-0596-4ee5-a379-bc8c2024bb67", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "027a4eceeb2ef9c48560f435acea971b285096a564ddc06d15da6cfbcb1333a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Against this points the fact that no change took\nplace in medication during the year.\nIn women suffering from Syndrome-X (i.e.\nangina pectoris positive exercise test and normal\ncoronary angiogram) addition of estrogen to the\ntreatment has recently been shown to relieve\nbreast pain [13,14]. Furthermore, it has been re-\nported that estrogens might have antiischemic\nproperties, inducing longer exercise time and less\nST-segment depression in the exercise test situa-\ntion [15]. There was no worsening of the cardiac\nstatus on the whole, or of symptoms of angina\npectoris in the estrogen treated women compared\nwith placebo.

In the two cases of TIA, it is\nuncertain whether they were related to HRT.\nCompliance was evaluated in relation to posi-\ntive and negative effects of treatment.

Both negative and\npositive effects were seen in the placebo group,\nexcept for irregular bleedings Table 7.\nIt was desirable to test both 17b-estradiol and\nconjugated estrogens since 17b-estradiol is the\nmost used preparation for postmenopausal substi-\ntution therapy in Europe, while conjugated estro-\ngens are most commonly used in USA.

The es-\ntrogen component of HERS treatment\nis the likely cause because estrogen\nwithout progestin is associated with ve-\nnous thromboembolism3,4 and selec-\ntive estrogen receptor modulators also\nincrease the risk.10,11 Risk factors for\nthromboembolism in HERS partici-\npants included lower extremity frac-\nture, cancer, surgery, and nonsurgical\nhospitalization; use of aspirin or stat-\nins appeared to be protective.2\nHERS participants represent a popu-\nlation at relatively high absolute risk of\ndeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary em-\nbolism. The overall rate in the placebo\ngroup, 2.8 per 1000 person-years, is far\nhigher than that observed in healthy\nyoung postmenopausal women but\nresembles rates in other populations of\nelderly women.3,12 Therefore our esti-\nmated NNT, 1 excess thromboem-\nbolic event among every 50 to 65\nwomen taking hormones for 5 years, is\nprobably much smaller than it would\nbe for younger and healthier women.\nThe longer follow-up available in\nHERS II suggests that the relative risk\nfor venous thromboembolic events may\ndecrease after the second year of hor-\nmone therapy (P=.08).

Late in\n1999, with 5 interim analyses com-\npleted, the DSMB observed small but\nconsistent early adverse effects in car-\ndiovascular outcomes and in the global\nindex. None of the disease-specific\nboundaries had been crossed. In the\nspring of 2000 and again in the spring\nof 2001, at the direction of the DSMB,\nhormone trial participants were given\ninformation indicating that increases in\nMI, stroke, and PE/DVT had been ob-\nserved and that the trial continued be-\ncause the balance of risks and benefits\nremained uncertain.\nIn reviewing the data for the 10th in-\nterim analyses on May 31, 2002, the\nDSMB found that the adverse effects in\ncardiovascular diseases persisted, al-\nthoughtheseresultswerestillwithinthe\nmonitoring boundaries.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22616, "end_char_idx": 24687, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c5f0441-3abc-4528-a190-ef929e088abb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c5f0441-3abc-4528-a190-ef929e088abb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "WHI-2002-3.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f61d22f3f151628a2dfcbade53c02b530364a162c681ff2529042f466a290f17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d88ef65-6b88-4641-b47b-a0cd64c42607", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "904b25d5f9d712aacbff75cada7f8c1943902ed2bc8ffbc753737b4aa1ad3b56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d56d81da-6dd2-436c-8247-82f518265d94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2592dec59733e49b4dffff190fc22da6c85763afc7cd75aaeadf1a2999667de3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, the\ndesign-specified weighted log-rank test\nstatistic for breast cancer (z=\u22123.19)\ncrossed the designated boundary\n(z=\u22122.32)andtheglobalindexwassup-\nportive of a finding of overall harm\n(z=\u22121.62).

The WHI en-\nrolled a cohort of mostly healthy, eth-\nnically diverse women, spanning a large\nage range (50-79 years at baseline). It\nis noteworthy that the increased risks\nfor cardiovascular disease and inva-\nsive breast cancer were present across\nracial/ethnic and age strata and were not\ninfluenced by the antecedent risk sta-\ntus or prior disease. Hence, the results\nare likely to be generally applicable to\nhealthy women in this age range. At the\ntime the trial was stopped, the in-\ncreases in numbers of invasive breast\ncancers, CHD, stroke, and PE made ap-\nproximately equal contributions to\nharm in the estrogen plus progestin\ngroup compared with placebo, which\nwere not counterbalanced by the\nsmaller reductions in numbers of hip\nfractures and colorectal cancers.\nCardiovascular Disease\nEven though the trial was stopped early\nfor harm from breast cancer, a suffi-\ncient number of CHD events had oc-\ncurred by 5.2 years of average fol-\nlow-up to suggest that continuation to\nthe planned end would have been un-\nlikely to yield a favorable result for the\nprimary outcome of CHD.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45252, "end_char_idx": 47230, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a0321a6-2cf3-4095-9e0b-9d67670dd787": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a0321a6-2cf3-4095-9e0b-9d67670dd787", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "WHI-2002-3.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f61d22f3f151628a2dfcbade53c02b530364a162c681ff2529042f466a290f17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "12d06b29-4f77-4d9f-b7cd-120dbecb4f93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7aa5541657a280e68803aa097dbe44590b6042d5e18303113c0a118eb40e1abb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6616d366-2a15-484b-869f-3f160a77e28a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b143de3b7f1b163c4d4aeac2af228e1fb652423a5419dfd18d67d16c6d2932ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Even if there\nwere a reversal of direction toward ben-\nefit of a magnitude seen in the obser-\nvational studies (ie, a risk reduction of\n55%) during the remaining years, con-\nditional power analyses indicate that\nless than 10% power remained for\nshowing potential benefit if the trial\ncontinued.\nThe WHI finding that estrogen plus\nprogestin does not confer benefit for\npreventing CHD among women with\na uterus concurs with HERS findings\namong women with clinically appar-\nent CHD,10 with the Estrogen Replace-\nment for Atherosclerosis trial, in which\nestrogen plus progestin did not in-\nhibit progression,23 and with a trial in\nwomen with unstable angina that did\nnot observe a reduction in ischemic\nevents.24 The finding of an increased\nrisk after initiation of treatment in WHI\nis similar to HERS.

In\nthe HRT group, all events happened within 261 days after inclusion.\nThe sequential design did not stop the study, but strongly indicated a\ndifference between the two groups. Our data strongly suggests that \nwomen who have previously suffered a VTE have an increased risk of\nrecurrence on HRT. This treatment should therefore be avoided in this\npatient group if possible. The results also support those of  recent \nepidemiological studies, which also indicate increased risk of VTE in\nnon-selected female populations during HRT. \nIntroduction\nAn increasing number of women are eligible for hormone \nreplacement therapy (HRT), but the evaluation of the benefits and \nhazards of HRT still needs further investigation. The relief of \nclimacteric symptoms, which improves quality of life, is recognized\n(1), and also the prevention of osteoporosis (2-4). HRT may on the\nother hand adversely increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancers\n(5, 6).\nNumerous epidemiological studies strongly suggest that HRT may\nreduce the risk of arterial vascular thrombosis (7). However, the first\nrandomized trial, the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study\n(HERS), did not confirm a reduction in the overall rate of coronary\nheart disease events in women with established coronary artery disease\n(8).\nThe evidence on the effect of HRT on the risk of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) is contradictory. Early epidemiological \nstudies failed to show an increased risk of VTE among users (9-13), but\nrecent studies suggest a 2-4 fold increased risk for current users \n(14-19). Five recent review articles have re-evaluated the risk \nassociated with HRT use and the authors unanimously conclude that an\nassociation may exist, but that further investigations are required and\nclinical trials warranted (20-24).  \nThe present randomized clinical trial was initiated to test whether\nestradiol treatment influences the risk of VTE.  We chose to study \nindividuals at high risk, since the much higher incidence of VTE in \nthese individuals might help to detect a clinically relevant effect with a\nmuch smaller sample size than would have been required for low-risk\nfemales.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1625, "end_char_idx": 3860, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0db739f5-66e1-46ce-9555-41865f2905bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0db739f5-66e1-46ce-9555-41865f2905bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "EVTET.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a446ae8819d7d2cb416fca9f6d60a17adb57a79c1f0cf87a72eb02aa46810506", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e087812-7e8a-4b17-a66f-0ae2c25fbf62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae9f211e2129308cf0a83796840c6fb0174a5b829621928b721da086685b812e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "771e8eab-e54b-4b7a-8a29-61bf370fadaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08b733ee97fa893383c599e6fda9987619b3f619edf083d7c4e4b0cd451429d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The study was terminated prematurely as several novel \nepidemiological studies (14-19) and one randomized study published\nduring execution of the study indicated increased risk of VTE (8). \nParticipants, Materials and Methods\nStudy Population\nParticipants were postmenopausal women younger than 70 years who had\nsuffered previous DVT or PE.

Written, informed consent was\nobtained from all women. The study was carried out in accordance with the\nHelsinki Declaration and Good Clinical Practice.\nProcedures\nAt the inclusion visit, data were collected on demographic characteristics,\nreproductive and health history, risk factors for VTE, and medication use. \nParticipants had a clinical examination, including breast and pelvic \nexaminations with cytological smear test and evaluation of the endometrium\nwith transvaginal ultrasound. A screening mammogram was also performed.\nRoutine hematological and clinical chemistry screening including blood \nlipids were performed at baseline and at each follow-up visit. A baseline \nthrombophilia assessment, i.e., screening for antithrombin, protein C, and \nprotein S deficiencies, activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant and\nanti-cardiolipin antibodies, and the factor V Leiden mutation and the \nprothrombin gene 20210 GA allele variation were made.\nAll women were given detailed instructions on symptoms and signs of \nDVT and PE, and advised to contact their own physician, local hospital, the \ninvestigator, or a 24-h operated telephone number immediately if symptoms \noccurred. \nScheduled follow-up visits occurred after 3 and 12 months, and an end-\nof-study visit after 24 months. Women who withdrew their consent to \nparticipate were followed until the time of consent withdrawal. Every visit \nincluded general physical examination and venipuncture. The end-of study \nvisit also included pelvic examination with cytological smear test and \nevaluation of the endometrium with transvaginal ultrasound and a screening\nmammogram. At 6 and 18 months, the women were followed up by postal \nquestionnaires. Adverse events reported by the patient spontaneously, given in\nresponse to direct questioning, or observed on clinical examination were \nevaluated by the investigator. \nAssignment\nThe study was carried out as a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-\ncontrolled study combined with a stratified double-triangular sequential design\n(Fig. 2) (25).

Novel epidemiological\nstudies published during execution of our study (14-19) clearly indicated \nthat HRT might increase the risk of VTE. After publication of the results of the\nrandomized HERS study, which showed as a secondary end-point an increased\nrisk of VTE (8), recruitment of women was discontinued in September 1998,\nuntil reviewed by the safety-monitoring committee. The committee was also\nconcerned about a non-significant clustering of end-points in one study group,\nbut without knowing treatment allocation (Fig. 2). The committee advised on\npremature termination of the study even though formal boundaries showing an\nexcess risk of VTE were not reached. The final decision on termination of the\nstudy was made in February 1999, and by the end of March 1999, all the \nparticipants had completed a final follow-up visit. \nResults\nPrevious Diseases and Baseline Parameters\nAltogether 140 women were enrolled in the study: 71 were allocated\nto receive HRT and 69 to receive placebo (Fig. 1). Participants ranged\nin age from 42 to 69 years, with a mean of 55.8 years at baseline. \nNinety-eight women were below 60 years old (first stratum), while 42\nwomen were above 60 years old (second stratum). Distribution of \ndemographics including age, body mass index, smoking habits, \nprevious and concomitant illnesses, serum lipid levels, and blood \npressure showed no significant differences between the two treatment\ngroups (Table 1).\nBefore inclusion in the study all women had experienced at least one\nprevious event of VTE.

This is the first-ever randomized trial on the effect of\nHRT with VTE as a primary end-point. Our results are only valid for\nwomen with previous VTE, but they support the evidence of an early\nexcess risk of VTE associated with use of HRT detected in recent \nepidemiological studies on healthy women (14-19) and with the excess\nincidence of VTE events observed in the randomized HERS-study (8).\nThe estimated 2-4 fold relative increased risk for VTE among HRT\nusers is of the same magnitude as the risk associated with oral contra-\nceptive use. Since the baseline incidence of VTE is much higher in\npostmenopausal women than in women of reproductive age, HRT may\nlead to a considerably higher number of women developing VTE \n(absolute risk) than does oral contraceptive use. In populations with\nhigh use of HRT, its impact on the overall frequency of VTE could \ntherefore be substantial. \nOur study is too small to carry out subgroup analysis, but it is known\nthat two clinical factors appear to be important for the risk of recurrent\nthrombosis: presence or absence of transient risk factors for VTE \n(26, 28, 33-35) and the time elapsed since VTE. Our treatment groups\nwere similar with regard to risk factors for VTE. Neither did time from\nprevious VTE to inclusion in the study show statistically significant\ndifference between groups.\nThe rate of identified thrombophilia was low. Only 35 (25%) had\nhereditary or acquired thrombophilia, which is lower than that reported\nin recent studies (27, 36). The reason for this may be due to patient \nselection.

Our study population may therefore\nrepresent a group at lower risk than an unselected population with \nprevious VTE. Protein C and protein S deficiencies were not detected,\nbut heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was identified in 23\n(16.5%) of the women. Only 4 of these women had already been \nidentified prior to study entry. \nThrombophilia was associated with an excess risk of recurrent\nthrombosis, but thrombophilia can not completely explain the increased\nrisk for recurrence in our study. Heterozygous factor V Leiden \nmutation was only a weak risk factor for recurrence. Three women with\nhomozygous factor V Leiden mutation were included, and two of these\nwere allocated HRT. One of the latter women, a 69-year old woman\nwith severe osteoporosis, developed a PE 64 days after inclusion. \nHer only previous VTE was a spontaneous DVT  9 months prior to \ninclusion. The other patient was a 49-year old woman who had had a\nspontaneous DVT 10 years prior to the study. She completed the two-\nyear period on HRT without adverse events. Homozygosity for the \nLeiden mutation has been reported to be associated with a 50-100 fold\nexcess  risk for VTE (37).\nIt is probable that estrogen acts in some women as an additional risk\nfactor to generate a hypercoagulable state. In some individuals the \npre-existing risk may be high and HRT may act as a trigger of \nthrombosis at an early stage of treatment.

This is \nunderlined by the fact that one of the major problems recruiting women\nto the study was that many women with previous VTE were already\nestablished on HRT, or they did not want to enter the study in fear of\nbeing allocated placebo (Figure 1). Secondly, it was emphasized that\nparticipants were well informed regarding symptoms and signs of VTE\nand encouraged to contact the investigator at any time during the study.\nFinally, the statistical model gave an opportunity to assess differences\nbetween groups throughout the study. \nIn conclusion, our study provides evidence, which strongly supports\nthat initiating HRT in women with previous VTE most probably \nincreases the risk of recurrent VTE. The incidence of recurrence was\napproximately 11% on HRT as compared to 2% on placebo. The \nincreased risk is obviously clinically relevant, and prescribing HRT in\nsuch women should be avoided in most cases or only be given with\ngreat care. However, the net balance of risk and benefit of HRT use\nmust also consider the potential beneficial health effects of relieving\nclimacteric symptoms (1), reducing the risk of osteoporosis (2, 3), and\npossibly the risk of coronary heart disease (7). In women with no risk\nfactors for VTE, the excess risk for VTE associated with HRT use\nwould appear to be small as compared with the potentially stronger \nbeneficial effects. Even in women with previous VTE or strong risk\nfactors for VTE, the balance of risk and benefits might still favor \nthe use of HRT in some cases. In such individuals, use of HRT in \ncombination with oral anticoagulant treatment could be another safe\napproach, but this hypothesis needs confirmation in clinical trials. \nCommittees\nSteering Committee: Dr. Per Morten Sandset (chairman), professor Harald\nArnesen, professor Stig Larsen, professor Erik Qvigstad, and Dr. Egil \nWickstr\u00f8m.\nFig.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22663, "end_char_idx": 24636, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f19749f6-2c4c-4843-bdd1-fb1d57b37495": {"__data__": {"id_": "f19749f6-2c4c-4843-bdd1-fb1d57b37495", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "EVTET.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a446ae8819d7d2cb416fca9f6d60a17adb57a79c1f0cf87a72eb02aa46810506", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "443034c4-13d7-4a1d-a0fc-0d720f8ab6f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8038bf1c240704731d79ac859617d3819ccb97b5d524c65bfc10dd45b7608200", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "26391417-4538-4c4c-843a-8becd29db1d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ab93a528a68495ff1382f6ed921a8cd15c1f7518179a3619d2f7cbacf2e801", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Per Morten Sandset (chairman), professor Harald\nArnesen, professor Stig Larsen, professor Erik Qvigstad, and Dr. Egil \nWickstr\u00f8m.\nFig. 3\nKaplan Meier plot indicating the proportion of patients without \nrecurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) as a function of time from \nrandomization by treatment group, i.e., HRT (continuous line) and placebo\nDownloaded by: State University of New York at Stony Brook.

The aim of this study was to\nascertain whether or not unopposed oestrogen reduces the\nrisk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women\nwho survive a first myocardial infarction.\nMethods The study was a randomised, blinded, placebo\ncontrolled, secondary prevention trial of postmenopausal\nwomen, age 50\u201369 years (n=1017) who had survived a first\nmyocardial infarction. Individuals were recruited from 35\nhospitals in England and Wales. Women received either one\ntablet of oestradiol valerate (2 mg; n=513) or placebo\n(n=504), daily for 2 years. Primary outcomes were\nreinfarction or cardiac death, and all-cause mortality.\nAnalyses were by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes\nwere uterine bleeding, endometrial cancer, stroke or other\nembolic events, and fractures.\nFindings Frequency of reinfarction or cardiac death did not\ndiffer between treatment groups at 24 months (rate ratio\n0\u00b799, 95% CI 0\u00b770\u20131\u00b741, p=0\u00b797). Similarly, the reduction\nin all-cause mortality between those who took oestrogen\nand those on placebo was not significant (0\u00b779, 0\u00b750\u20131\u00b727,\np=0\u00b734). The relative risk of any death (0\u00b756, 0\u00b723\u20131\u00b733)\nand cardiac death (0\u00b733, 0\u00b711\u20131\u00b701) was lowest at \n3 months post-recruitment. \nInterpretation Oestradiol valerate does not reduce the\noverall risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal\nwomen who have survived a myocardial infarction. \nLancet 2002; 360: 2001\u201308.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1740, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fa9d730-26c2-4e79-9b69-ebef0c9f405d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fa9d730-26c2-4e79-9b69-ebef0c9f405d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "SPRIT (2002).pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8b48ad9a459f1b5d42664f42b26c291c6787bc2fd9d9c4c25e6d29ee428847b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c90477f-59a2-4d84-8be0-315f9f2d5905", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "def40f6aedcddd76c30952694936d05652d548484b24ac99d2a60f147fac6535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f67883d-eb7e-4df1-a9c5-87642ff53c85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60c4bcb5711d868215e6c02dd4ab9bcbc9d4785821f89477b108001c711b72bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Lancet 2002; 360: 2001\u201308.

Hulley, MD, MPH;\nfor the HERS Research Group\nBackground\u2014Observational studies have shown that postmenopausal hormone therapy may increase, decrease, or have no\neffect on the risk of stroke. To date, no clinical trial has examined this question. To investigate the relation between\nestrogen plus progestin therapy and risk of stroke among postmenopausal women, we analyzed data collected from the\nHeart & Estrogen-progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a secondary coronary heart disease prevention trial.\nMethods and Results\u2014Postmenopausal women (n52763) were randomly assigned to take conjugated estrogen plus\nprogestin or placebo. Primary outcomes for these analyses were stroke incidence and stroke death during a mean\nfollow-up of 4.1 years. The number of women with strokes was compared with the number of women without strokes.\nA total of 149 women (5%) had 1 or more strokes, 85% of which were ischemic, resulting in 26 deaths. Hormone\ntherapy was not significantly associated with risk of nonfatal stroke (relative hazard [RH] 1.18; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.66),\nfatal stroke (RH 1.61; 95% CI 0.73 to 3.55), or transient ischemic attack (RH 0.90; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.42). Independent\npredictors of stroke events included increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, current cigarette smoking, and atrial\nfibrillation. Black women were at increased risk compared with white women, and unexpectedly, body mass index was\ninversely associated with stroke risk.\nConclusions\u2014Hormone therapy with conjugated equine estrogen and progestin had no significant effect on the risk for\nstroke among postmenopausal women with coronary disease.

Comparison of EPAT participants\nwho received lipid-lowering medication and ERT with\nparticipants who received ERT but no lipid-lowering\nmedication con\ufb01rms this idea. Subanalyses of other\nnonrandomized treatment regimens have not yet been\nreported in HERS or ERA.\nAlthough observational data indicate that HRT is\nassociated with a lower incidence of coronary heart dis-\nease in postmenopausal women, most of these data are\nassociations with unopposed ERT in women without\nsymptomatic coronary heart disease (5, 6). The observa-\ntional arterial imaging studies that support an HRT-\nrelated reduction of atherosclerosis have studied unop-\nposed ERT (26\u201332).\nUnopposed ERT inhibited development of athero-\nsclerosis in several animal models (45\u201348). It is conceiv-\nable that HRT in general, and unopposed ERT speci\ufb01-\ncally, may be most effective as primary prevention, when\natherosclerosis is in its early stages, rather than as sec-\nondary prevention, when atherosclerosis is in a later,\nestablished phase. In other words, ERT may be effective\nin the prevention rather than the treatment of athero-\nsclerosis. This notion is consistent with the possible\nproin\ufb02ammatory effects of estrogen. Estrogen increases\nlevels of C-reactive protein (49\u201352), a marker of under-\nlying in\ufb02ammation that is associated with cardiovascular\nevents in women (53). Estrogen may reduce early pre-\nintrusive atherosclerosis in healthy women but not car-\ndiovascular events if it promotes arterial thrombosis or\natherosclerotic plaque destabilization in women with es-\ntablished cardiovascular disease. This scenario appears\nto be consistent with the early events reported in\nHERS (40).\nIt is unclear whether sequential therapy with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate or other progestational\nagents would result in a different clinical outcome than\nthat seen with continuous combined therapy in HERS\nand ERA.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 44783, "end_char_idx": 46810, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdaed207-06fc-40aa-b191-b804ffdea7e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdaed207-06fc-40aa-b191-b804ffdea7e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "EPAT.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "636935c48f41e4838b3b1279f92ccca6a3d1c6dacdf5b549eb138d740400f7ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f08add5-59b2-4721-aa77-cd84a1219d9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2912dab4a7152ef05e3a804a84531510ecce029329846a2420c559217bd0fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c74b129-58f3-4282-8ace-1dbee4d4e08d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "885e112ccc9b3c78e0e31835a762d8774affe421c79abb7cd7458e9ca85a9b16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "It is unclear whether sequential therapy with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate or other progestational\nagents would result in a different clinical outcome than\nthat seen with continuous combined therapy in HERS\nand ERA. These and other questions concerning the role\nof HRT in the prevention and treatment of atheroscle-\nrotic disease in postmenopausal women need further\nstudy. As the initial randomized, controlled trials of ath-\nerosclerosis end points in this important area of wom-\nen\u2019s health, EPAT, HERS, and ERA indicate new direc-\ntions for further investigation.\nConclusions\nOverall, we found that healthy postmenopausal\nwomen without preexisting cardiovascular disease who\nrandomly received unopposed ERT with 17b-estradiol\nhad less progression of subclinical atherosclerosis than\ndid those who received placebo. In subgroup analyses,\nthis result was seen only in women not receiving lipid-\nlowering medication. The reduction of the progression\nof subclinical atherosclerosis associated with ERT was of\nthe same magnitude as that in women who received\nlipid-lowering medication. Furthermore, lipid-lowering\nmedication appeared not to add bene\ufb01t to unopposed\nERT in reducing the progression of subclinical athero-\nsclerosis. Although the use of lipid-lowering medication\nwas not randomized in EPAT, these results are impor-\ntant because they suggest that unopposed ERT can serve\nas an alternative to lipid-lowering medication as preven-\ntive therapy to slow the progression of subclinical ath-\nerosclerosis in postmenopausal women who cannot or\ndo not wish to use lipid-lowering medication.\nSince most women who enter menopause are\nasymptomatic for cardiovascular disease and 95% of\nwomen who develop cardiovascular disease do so after\nmenopause, our results suggest that administration of\nunopposed 17b-estradiol to women entering menopause\nmay slow the progression of atherosclerosis and its clin-\nical sequelae (11, 12, 22\u201325).

A 50-year-old woman\ntoday has about a 46% lifetime probability of developing CHD and a 31%\nchance of dying from it [2]. Many observational studies have found that oral\npostmenopausal estrogen therapy is associated with a 35\u201350% reduction in risk\nof CHD [2\u20134]. The apparent protective effect of estrogen therapy may be even\nstronger in women who already have CHD [5].\nThe reported association between postmenopausal estrogen therapy and\nreduced CHD risk, though consistent, biologically plausible, and strong, could\nbe confounded if women taking estrogen have a more favorable cardiovascular\nrisk pro\ufb01le than nonusers [6, 7]. Only a comparison of hormone use and placebo\nin women who are randomly assigned to therapy can provide de\ufb01nitive evi-\ndence that treatment reduces the risk of CHD. We are therefore conducting\nthe Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a randomized,\ndouble-blind trial of the effect of estrogen plus progestin therapy on the fre-\nquency of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction among postmeno-\npausal women with known CHD.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nParticipants in the HERS are 2763 postmenopausal women <79 years old\nwho have a uterus and who have CHD evidenced by prior myocardial in-\nfarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, mechanical revascularization,\nor angiographic evidence of at least a 50% occlusion of one or more major\ncoronary arteries.\nWomen were excluded if their reported CHD event had occurred within 6\nmonths of randomization, if they had used postmenopausal hormone therapy\nwithin 3 months of the initial screening, if hormone therapy was thought to\nbe contraindicated, if they were participating in another trial, or if they were\nthought to be unlikely to adhere to the protocol (Table 1).\nWomen of any race were included.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3467, "end_char_idx": 5530, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6eef261b-6eda-4039-9cad-c3ac167491ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "6eef261b-6eda-4039-9cad-c3ac167491ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HERS-1.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75410f0d3f353a178bbde3490a35d854aa3a1c17c0044dec859924eecf102528", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ced01461-a732-4ef9-833c-7d443b061ccd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "483493b48bedaf676ef30f1f5a66fd9e007dd0e4bf8686a11f41f55a7953d1d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "935e495e-ef74-4177-ae98-47024587dc23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59c58c60d773126b5b9783b495fe812852987bd0b377475cc51bf49e295c549a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Women of any race were included.

If some\nof these medications, such as lipid-lowering medications or aspirin, have the\nsame mechanism of action as estrogen, the effect of therapy may be diminished.\nBecause only 10% of the women enrolled in the HERS are nonwhite, the general-\nizability of the study \ufb01ndings will be limited if estrogen therapy has different\neffects in nonwhite women.\nThe Postmenopausal Estrogen Progestin Interventions Trial (PEPI) was a\nrandomized trial in 875 postmenopausal women to determine the effects of 3\nyears of treatment with estrogen and various estrogen plus progestin regimens\non CHD risk factors such as serum lipoprotein levels, blood pressure, fasting\nglucose, insulin, and \ufb01brinogen [8]. The PEPI participants were younger than\nthe women enrolled in HERS (less than 65 years old at enrollment) and did\nnot have heart disease. The most important difference between HERS and PEPI\nis that PEPI was not designed to evaluate the effect of HRT on CHD events.\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) Randomized Trial [24] is a primary\nprevention trial to determine whether hormone therapy reduces the risk of\nCHD events in healthy women. The WHI will enroll approximately 25,000\nwomen. Those without a uterus will be randomized to conjugated equine\nestrogen 0.625 mg daily or placebo. Women with a uterus will be randomized\nto estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily or placebo. The\nintervention in the WHI is planned to continue for 9 years, so its results are\nnot expected before the year 2005.\nThe HERS is the largest trial of any intervention to reduce the risk of recurrent\nCHD events in women with heart disease and the \ufb01rst to seek controlled clinical\ntrial evidence of the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of postmenopausal hormone therapy\nto prevent recurrent CHD.\nFunding for the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) is provided by Wyeth-\nAyerst Laboratories, Radnor, PA.\n332\nD.
